# Fundamentals 
* Three regions of combat engagement
	* **Long range** - allows engagement with a rifle, a bayonet, or weapons of opportunity
	* **Mid-range** - allows engagement with knives, punches or kicks 
	* **Short range** - allows for grappling and grabbing. 
* Target areas that are easily accessible
	* The head - especially the eyes, temple, nose, ears, and jaw. *Massive damage to the skull is lethal*.
	* Neck - vital blood vessels, the trachea, upper spine 
	* Torso - clavicle, ribs, solar plexus, internal organs, spine 
	* Groin 
	* Extremities - for immobilizing a limb. 
* **Warrior Stance**: Feet Apart, Hands Up, Elbows In, Chin Down. 

### General Principles
* Movement is necessary to gain an advantage over the enemy. Movement is made in approximately 45 degree angles for maximum effect.
* *The key is to be relaxed*. Counter the natural tendency to tense up.
* *Avoid telegraphing your moves*. Conversely, exploit your opponent's tells. This builds up on being relaxed.
* The *goal is to generate power* typically through movement, but also through your own weight or momentum.

# Strikes 
## Punches 
* Punching is a reflexive behavior, but we should aim to maximize the impact. 
	* Relax the forearms. Clench the fist at the point of impact to cause the most damage.
	* Clench the fist only when movement has begun 
	* Before impact, apply tension to the hand and forearm for safety and maximizing damage.
	* Contact should be made with the first two knuckles.
* **Weight Transfer** - pivot the body to generate more power. 
	* Rotate the hips and shoulders.
	* Move the body forward. 
	* Drop body weight onto the aggressor. 
* *Quickly retract your hand and return to the Warrior stance to avoid being grabbed and to react to the opponent's next move*. 
* If possible, *aim for soft tissue areas*.

* **Lead Hand Punch** - a fast unexpected punch executed by the lead hand. 
	* It conceals movement, stuns the aggressor, lets you get closer to the aggressor. 
* **Rear Hand Punch** - a powerful punch executed by the rear hand designed to inflict maximum damage. 
	* It exploits the distance travelled by the rear hand as well as weight transfer)
* **Uppercut** - a powerful punch originating below the aggressor's line of vision, usually close. 
	* Usually follows a preparatory strike. 
	* When delivered to the chin or jaw, it can cause unconsciousness, damage the neck or sever the tongue.
	* The power derives from the upward motion of the lower body.
* **Hook** - a powerful punch executed close, usually after a preparatory strike.
	* Like the uppercut when aimed at the neck or chin. It can also break ribs when aimed at the chest.
	* Power is derived from the use of the legs and rotating the upper body.
