* MCMAP is designed to be efficient, especially when carrying combat gear. The style is characterized by stunning and then killing your opponent. 
* The training policy of MCMAP also emphasizes efficiency. The techniques are relatively basic, however, it  can be argued that this is because Marines have a lot to learn to be combat ready, and  in modern warfare, the focus ought to be on marksmanship than melee
* The specific steps to each technique below can be found in the [[United States Marine Corps Martial Arts Instruction Manual]]. 
# Fundamentals 
* Three regions of combat engagement
	* **Long range** - allows engagement with a rifle, a bayonet, or weapons of opportunity
	* **Mid-range** - allows engagement with knives, punches or kicks 
	* **Short range** - allows for grappling and grabbing. 
* Target areas that are easily accessible
	* The head - especially the eyes, temple, nose, ears, and jaw. Massive damage to the skull is lethal.
	* Neck - vital blood vessels, the trachea, upper spine 
	* Torso - clavicle, ribs, solar plexus, internal organs, spine 
	* Groin 
	* Extremities - for immobilizing a limb. 
* **Warrior Stance**: Feet Apart, Hands Up, Elbows In, Chin Down. 

* Movement is necessary to gain an advantage over the enemy. Movement is made in approximately 45 degree angles for maximum effect.
* *The key is to be relaxed*. Counter the natural tendency to tense up.
* *Avoid telegraphing your moves*. Conversely, exploit your opponent's tells. This builds up on being relaxed.
* The *goal is to generate power* typically through movement, but also through your own weight or the momentum generated by your body through weight transfer. This can involve.
	* Hip and shoulder rotation 
	* Stepping forward in the direction of an attack 
	* Moving the hands in the direction of the attack 
	* Using the arms to drive a swinging motion further 
	* Dropping your body weight on the aggressor 

# Strikes 
* All strikes follow the same principles:
	* *Generate power through weight transfer*. Rotate the hips and shoulders into the attack; Move your body mass straight; Drop your body weight on the aggressor. 
	* *Muscular Tension*. There should be muscular tension in the hand and forearm at the moment of impact to maximize damage to the aggressor and to avoid injury to your hand.
	* *Follow Through*. A strike should be delivered so that the weapon such as the hand, or the elbow, hits and remains on the impact target and follows through the target
		* Strikes with the arms are executed with heavy hands, which means that the strike is executed by driving through with the strike to allow the weight of the hand to go through the primary target area of the body.
		* Contact on an aggressor should be made with the arm slightly bent, the arm extends as it moves through the target.
		* *Follow throughs make strikes not have to be executed at full force*. 
	* *Movement*. Position yourself to launch an attack against the aggressor.
	* *Targeting areas*. Pinpoint accuracy is not needed for a strike to be effective. Some target areas are the abdominals, ribs, kidneys, chest and head. 

## Punches 
* *Quickly retract your hand and return to the Warrior stance to avoid being grabbed and to react to the opponent's next move*. 
* If possible, *aim for soft tissue areas*.

* **Lead Hand Punch** - a fast unexpected punch executed by the lead hand. 
	* It conceals movement, stuns the aggressor, and lets you get closer to the aggressor. 
* **Rear Hand Punch** - a powerful punch executed by the rear hand designed to inflict maximum damage. 
	* It exploits the distance travelled by the rear hand as well as weight transfer
* **Uppercut** - a powerful punch originating below the aggressor's line of vision, usually close. 
	* Usually follows a preparatory strike. 
	* When delivered to the chin or jaw, it can cause unconsciousness, damage the neck or sever the tongue.
	* The power derives from the upward motion of the lower body.
* **Hook** - a powerful punch executed close, usually after a preparatory strike.
	* Like the uppercut when aimed at the neck or chin. It can also break ribs when aimed at the chest.
	* Power is derived from the use of the legs and rotating the upper body.

## Upper Body Strikes 
* The purpose of these strikes is to stun the aggressor or set them up for a finishing technique using the hands, forearms or elbows. 
* **Hammer Fist** - concentrates power at a small part of the hand which, when transferred to the target, can have a devastating effect. 
	* When thrown horizontally, the power comes from hip-shoulder rotation.
	* When thrown vertically, the power comes from dropping the weight on the aggressor by bending the knees and transferring your weight. 
* **Eye Gouge** - used to attack the aggressor's eyes to blind them and so that follow up can be executed. The hand is thrust into the aggressor's eyes.
	* Aim for the nose and let the hand slide on the nose to the eye socket.
* **Elbow Strike** - inflicts damage due to the leverage. The striking surface is the elbow area. 
	* **Vertical Elbow Strike**: The target is usually the chin. The elbow is driven up using hip-shoulder rotation. 
	* **Forward Horizontal Elbow Strike**: The target is the temple, spine, jaw or face. The elbow is driven sideways using hip-shoulder rotation. 

## Lower Body Strikes 
* Their purpose is to stop an attack or create an opening using the legs and the knees. 

* **Vertical Knee Strike**: used to maximize damage to the aggressor using the top of the knee. Aim for the head, sternum or groin. 
	* *Do not use the knee cap* as this is a bone. 
	* Do not interlace your fingers when grabbing the enemy so they cannot break out. 
	* Momentum is driven from both pulling the aggressor down and raising the knee. 
* **Front Kick** - stops the aggressor's forward momentum by a strike using the toes. Aim for the groin, knee, shin, or inner thigh
	* Shift weight to the non-kicking leg to maintain balance. 
	* Never extend the foot above the waist because it is difficult to maintain power. 
	* You are somewhat open when you perform the kick since you cannot change direction. 
* **Round Kick** - a kick that makes use of the bottom half of the shins. Aim for the outer portion of the leg, femur, knee, calf or Achilles tendon. 
	* The round house motion is driven by hip-shoulder rotation. 
* **Vertical Stomp** - allows you to remain upright and balanced to deliver multiple blows with either foot on a downed aggressor using the bootheel. 
	* Aim for the head or other extremities and drop your weight, concentrated on the bootheel, on the enemy. 

# Maneuver 
## Break Fall 
* The aim is to reduce injury by absorbing impact in case of a fall or throw and to quickly get back up. 
* Keep the head away from the floor by tucking it in and raising it away from the floor. 
* The fall is dispersed by using the arms and the torso. Ideally, this is done by *falling as "flat" as possible*, that is, by having the whole body strike the floor at the same time. 

* **Front Break Fall*** - executed to break a fall falling forward.
* **Back Break Fall** - executed to break a fall falling backwards
* **Side Break Fall** - executed to break a fall falling sideways. Ideally, aim to land on a 45 degree angle, with the arm shielding the fall. 
* **Forward Shoulder Roll** - break a fall from an aggressor's attack and use the momentum to quickly get back up.
	* The feet push to roll over the shoulder to the right hip, as if executing a side break fall but with momentum.
	* *Do not dive*. Allow the forward momentum to bring you up. 

## Chokes 

## Throws 

# Bayonets 
* Keep movements of the bayonet blade within a box, shoulder width across from the neck down to the waistline. *Any wider, and the aggressor can block.*
* The goal of these techniques is to disable or kill the aggressor. 

* **Straight Thrust** - the deadliest technique. It causes the most trauma to the aggressor. 
	* The blade is thrust forward with additional momentum provided by the legs. 
* **Horizontal Buttstroke** - is used to weaken a defense by striking the enemy with the toe of the rifle's butt.
	* Best executed after a thrust, but should always be followed by a slash or thrust. 
	* The momentum comes from rotation of the hip and shoulder as well as the swinging motion of the arms.
* **Vertical Buttstroke** - similar to the horizontal buttstroke but the strike runs vertically, going upwards.
* **Smash** - used as a follow-on technique to a buttstroke, when the target was missed or to gain proper striking distance. 
	* The goal is to strike the enemy with the buttstock of the rifle. When retracting, step forward and close the distance. 
	* Momentum comes from thrusting the rifle's butt to the aggressor.
* **Slash** - used to cut through the aggressor's defenses. Best to follow up with a thrust.
	* The motion involves a diagonal cut (left to right) through the target. Power is generated by stepping with the left foot when slashing, and bringing the right foot back up. 
* **Disrupt** - a defensive technique to redirect or deflect an attack in preparation for a follow up. It is a slight redirection of a linear attack. 
	* Aim to redirect the weapon away from your body by using your weapon as a tool to exert pressure on the enemy's. Add additional momentum with hip and shoulder rotation.
	* Do not overexert it. *The aim is solely to make the enemy's weapon miss your body*.
