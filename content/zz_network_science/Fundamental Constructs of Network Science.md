* In a percolation process the **average cluster size** is defined as $$\braket{s}=|p-p_c|^{-\gamma_p}$$Where
	  $p_c$ is the breakdown threshold 
	  $\gamma_p$ is the critical exponent.
	  As $p\to p_c$ this value diverges 

* The **clustering coefficient** is a quantity, denoted $C_v$ which captures the degree to which the neighbors of $v$ link to each other to form a clique. 
  Let 
  $v$ be a vertex, with degree $d$.
  $L$ be the number of edges between the $d$ neighbors of $v$. 
  
  The clustering coefficient is calculated as 
  $$
  C_v=\frac{2L}{d(d-1)}
  $$
  It should be noted that 
  $$
  0\le C_v\le 1
  $$
