### The Team Sometimes Communicates through Documents
* *The magic template does not exist*. Game Design Documents are out of date the moment you write them. *GDDs are theories not specifications*. 
* GDDs have two purposes [[Knowledge in the Head and In the World|memory]] and communication. They record the design decisions that went into the game.
