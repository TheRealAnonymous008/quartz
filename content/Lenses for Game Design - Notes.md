### Game Mechanics Must Be in Balance 
* Balancing a game is nothing more than adjusting the elements of the game until they deliver the experience you want.

#### Fairness 
* Players want to feel that the forces working against them do not have an advantage that will make them impossible to defeat 
* **Symmetric Games** - players have equal powers and resources. Suitable for Competitive games.  
	* Balancing necessitates considering first-move advantage (either random or least skilled first)
* **Asymmetrical Games** - players have different resources and abilities. We may want this for a variety of reasons 
	* To simulate a real world experience 
	* To allow for exploration 
	* To allow personalization by giving players resources that match their skills.
	* To level the playing field. 
	* To create interesting situations
* One way to balance an Asymmetrical game is to give players the same total "sum value" of resources, with each resources having the same values.
* Another way is *circular balance* where there is a rock-paper-scissors dynamic. Something exists as a counter to something else.

#### Challenge vs Success
* The appropriate level of challenge keeps the [[Lenses for the Player#The Experience is in the Player's Mind|player]] in [[Flow State Model|flow]]. 
* Some common techniques for balancing:
	* Increase difficulty with each success. However, consider the tense and release pattern
	* Let players get through easy parts fast. 
	* Create layers of challenge (for example via a scoring system)
	* Let players choose the difficulty level (this comes at the cost of balancing more versions of the game)
	* Playtesting with a variety of players. 
	* Give the losers a break 
* It may make sense to consider what percentage of players do you want to complete the game. 
* *Remember*: Just learning the game is already a challenge

#### Meaningful Choice
* Games should have [[The Fundamentals of Game Design#Player Choice|meaningful]] choices. 
* [[Games as Rules#Game Theory Systems|Dominant strategies]] ruin game balance and make the game less fun. Balancing should get rid of dominant strategies
* The number of choices provided to the player should equal the number of things the player wants to do -- too much and its overwhelming, too little and the player is frustrated.
* Consider **triangularity** - the classic trade-off of low risk low reward and high risk high reward.

#### Skill vs Chance
* Chance and Player skill negate each other. 
* One common way to balance these is to alternate the use of chance and skill in the moment to moment gameplay. 
* According to David Perry, the key to addictive games is designing the game such that players are doing three things
	* Exercising a skill 
	* Taking a risk 
	* Working a strategy

#### Heads vs Hands
* Consider how much of the game should involve doing a challenging physical activity vs how much it should involve thinking, again taking into account the preferences of the target demographic.

#### Competition vs Cooperation
* Games provide avenues for both [[Games as Rules#Systems of Conflict|competition and cooperation]]. These can be combined and used in different ways.

#### Short vs Long 
* Balance should take into account the length of the gameplay
* Too short and choices will not be meaningful enough. 
* Too long and the game may feel like too much of a time commitment. 
* *The main factors that affect the duration of the game are the win conditions*. 

#### Reward
* Players are motivated by a certain desire that can be fulfilled by the game. 
* *Games can judge players, but they should judge so fairly*.
