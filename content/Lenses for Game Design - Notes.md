### In the Beginning, There is a Designer
* Game Design requires confidence, both in one's design abilities and in one's knowledge for a variety of disciplines.
* *The most important skill for a game designer is to listen* - listen to the team, the audience, the game, the client and the self. *Listen [[Reading#Getting Better at Reading|deeply]] and thoughtfully*. [^1]
* The major gift you can have when it comes to game design is to *love the art of [[Game Design]]*. 

### The Designer Creates an Experience
* The goal is not a game but an [[Games as Play|experience]] felt by the players. The game is not the experience. The game enables the experience. Experience is not really (objective) reality, but at the same time experience is all that is (subjectively) real for us.
* Game designers can only design the experience indirectly and this is why game design is hard. Games have to be [[The Fundamentals of Game Design#Interactivity|interactive]] which necessitates creating meaningful play
* We can use the results obtained from [[Psychology]], Anthropology and [[Design]] to guide the creation of experiences.

### The Experience Takes Place in a Venue
* **Private Venues** - play spaces that have some privacy (i.e., at home). We can divide the home into three areas -- 
	* The "hearth" which is the more noisy, public area, 
	* The "workbench" which is for intense activities performed alone and with focus, and 
	* The "reading nook" for more quiet, relaxing places of solitude.
* **Public Venues** - play spaces out in public. These include
	* The "theatre" for more interactive, dramatic experiences
	* The "arena" for public competitions
	* The "museum" for play spaces that involve exploration and selection from a variety of choice "exhibits"
* **Half-Private / Half-Public** - play spaces that lie on the boundary between private and public. This includes playgrounds, gaming tables, and "anywhere" -- games played anywhere at any time.

### The Experience Rises Out of a Game
* The following definitions are only relevant in the realm of design. Defining various aspects of games allows us to gain insight into what it is we are designing.

* *Fun is [[Games as Play#Play of Pleasure|pleasure]] with surprises*. Games are fun. 
* *Play is manipulation that indulges curiosity*. We play because we are willing to indulge in play, and we do it for its own sake.
* *Games are problem solving activities approached with a playful attitude*. In a sense, all games are fundamentally [[Puzzle|puzzles]] and we get the satisfaction from having solved the puzzle.

Curiosity|Curiosity]], [[Lenses for Game Design - Lenses#7. Endogenous Value|Endogenous value]], [[Lenses for Game Design - Lenses#8 . Problem Solving|Problem Solving]]

### The Game Consists of Elements
* **Mechanics** - the [[Games as Rules|rules]] of the game that describe the goals, the constraints, and the outcomes. 
* **Story** - the [[Narrative|sequence]] of events that unfolds in the game
* **Aesthetics** -- how the game appeals to the sensation. 
* **Technology** - any materials and interactions that make the game possible. It allows the game to do certain things and not do others.

* All of the above are equally important and influence each other. All should work towards the same goal -- the player experience.
	* Never forget the player experience. Not knowing the elements makes us ignorant to how we can improve the experience, but not knowing the experience can make the game [[The Psychology of Everyday Actions|horrible]].
* Deficits in one element of the tetrad can inspire creative designs in another.

### The Elements Support a Theme 
* The **theme** is what your game is about. It is the idea that ties your entire game together
* The primary benefit of basing your design around a single theme is that *all of the elements of your game will reinforce one another*, since they will all be working toward a common goal. 
	* The sooner the theme is identified, the better
	* When the theme is identified, reinforce it as much as possible.
* *The best theme is a theme that [[details/creativity/writing/Story by Robert McKee|resonates]] with players*. Those that are archetypal and universal and they elevate the game.
* Themes operate on the subconscious level. It is about focusing the experience to something important to the players.

### The Game Begins with an Idea 
* [[Creativity|Inspiration comes from everywhere else]]. Find one key emotional experience to build your game around.
* Fall in love with the problem, not the solution. The first step to the game design problem is to recognize there is a problem.
* Pay attention to your subconscious mind. It is your friend when it comes to creativity [^idea_1]
	* Pay Attention to yourself -- your thoughts, feelings and dreams.
	* Record your ideas all the time. 
	* Manage the subconscious mind's appetites judiciously. It cannot operate when it obsesses over something extensively. 
	* Sleep
	* Don't Push Too Hard. Don't expect immediate answers from the subconscious. 
* **Brainstorming Tips**
	* Write down the solutions that immediately pop into your brain. This frees up mental bandwidth for other ideas. 
	* Sketch. Draw some pictures and express your ideas visually. 
	* Use toys. Play with toys to engage with creativity visually and in a tactile way.
	* Change your perspective (i.e., your environment)
	* Immerse yourself in the problem 
	* Crack jokes to loosen your mind (but make sure to reorient yourself).
	* Spare no expense. Don't let materials get in the way of brainstorming.
	* Keep records of your ideas. That way they can easily be retrieved. Exploit the fact we have good spatial memory. 
	* Don't wait for the "one" idea, write everything down, even the stupid ideas.
	* Challenge and destroy your assumptions. Innovation can come from removing your assumptions. 
	* Mix and match categories .
	* Talk to yourself or with a partner. Bounce ideas off of someone.

[^idea_1]: The book alludes to a power nap technique by Dali who slept with a key in hand and a plate to catch the key. When the key dropped, it would make a sound to awake Dali. 
### The Game Improves through Iteration 
* **The Rule of the Loop** The process of game design and development is necessarily iterative, or looping. *The more you test and improve your design, the better your game will be*.
	* The goal should be to maximize each loop and to make the loop as fast as possible. [[Software Engineering]] techniques apply.
	* Identify risks -- problems within the current design. Eliminate risk as soon as possible via prototyping.

* **Tips for Productive Prototyping**
	* *Answer a question.* The prototype should be designed specifically for a design question.
	* *Forget Quality.* All that matters is if it can answer a question. 
	* *Don't get too attached.* The prototype is only temporary. 
	* *Prioritize prototypes* that tackle higher priority problems and risks. Also consider dependence -- if one prototype solves all other prototypes, do that first. 
	* *Parallelize prototypes productively.*  Do more than one at once
	* *Prototypes do not have to be digital.* Paper prototypes are low fidelity and enable faster iteration.
	* *Prototypes do not have to be interactive* 
	* *Pick a fast loop game engine*. Use systems that are responsive to changes. 
	* *Build the toy first* before the game. Let the game [[Games as Rules#Emergent Systems|emerge]]from the systems.
	* *Seize opportunities for more loops*. When given more time, use it for more loops.

* The Loop goes as follows.
	* State the problem 
	* Brainstorm some possible solutions 
	* Choose a solution 
	* List the risks of using that solution 
	* Build prototypes to mitigate the risks 
	* Test the prototypes. If they are good enough stop. 
	* State new problems and repeat. Often these problems are more narrow in scope.

* **The Method** (by Mark Cerny)  *You are in preproduction until you have finished two publishable levels of the game*, complete with all necessary features. Otherwise, you are still figuring out the fundamental design of the game. 
	* **The Plan to Cut Rule** - when planning your game, make sure to build it in such a way that if 50% of the budget were removed, the game would still be shippable. 
	* **The 50% Rule** - All core gameplay elements should be fully playable at the halfway mark in your schedule.
