### Game Mechanics Support Puzzles 
* More on [[Puzzle|puzzles]] here.  The principles for making [[Puzzle Design|good puzzles]] also apply. 
* Implicit puzzles satisfy the lens of [[Lenses for Game Design - Lenses#49. Elegance|elegance]] because they stimulate the head and serve additional purposes in game.

### Players Play games through an interface
* The **interface** is anything between the player and the game world.

* The less abstraction to our interface, the more we feel an emotional connection to the content. 
* The goal of the interface is for the player to feel in control of the experience. 
	* If the interface becomes second nature to the player, the player will project themselves into the game itself while ignoring the transparency.
* *The quality of the [[Knowing What To Do -- Constraints, Discoverability and Feedback|feedback]] provided by the interface determines how much the player understands the game*
	* **Tenth of a Second Rule**  If there is no immediate feedback (within a tenth of a second), the player will assume there is something wrong with the interface.
* Favor juicy systems - just a little interaction gives a continuous flow of reward.
