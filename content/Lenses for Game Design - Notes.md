### In the Beginning, There is a Designer
* Game Design requires confidence, both in one's design abilities and in one's knowledge for a variety of disciplines.
* *The most important skill for a game designer is to listen* - listen to the team, the audience, the game, the client and the self. *Listen [[Reading#Getting Better at Reading|deeply]] and thoughtfully*. [^1]
* The major gift you can have when it comes to game design is to *love the art of [[Game Design]]*. 

### The Designer Creates an Experience
* The goal is not a game but an [[Games as Play|experience]] felt by the players. The game is not the experience. The game enables the experience. Experience is not really (objective) reality, but at the same time experience is all that is (subjectively) real for us.
* Game designers can only design the experience indirectly and this is why game design is hard. Games have to be [[The Fundamentals of Game Design#Interactivity|interactive]] which necessitates creating meaningful play
* We can use the results obtained from [[Psychology]], Anthropology and [[Design]] to guide the creation of experiences.
