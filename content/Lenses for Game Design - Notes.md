### In the Beginning, There is a Designer
* Game Design requires confidence, both in one's design abilities and in one's knowledge for a variety of disciplines.
* *The most important skill for a game designer is to listen* - listen to the team, the audience, the game, the client and the self. *Listen [[Reading#Getting Better at Reading|deeply]] and thoughtfully*. [^1]
* The major gift you can have when it comes to game design is to *love the art of [[Game Design]]*. 

### The Designer Creates an Experience
* The goal is not a game but an [[Games as Play|experience]] felt by the players. The game is not the experience. The game enables the experience. Experience is not really (objective) reality, but at the same time experience is all that is (subjectively) real for us.
* Game designers can only design the experience indirectly and this is why game design is hard. Games have to be [[The Fundamentals of Game Design#Interactivity|interactive]] which necessitates creating meaningful play
* We can use the results obtained from [[Psychology]], Anthropology and [[Design]] to guide the creation of experiences.

### The Experience Takes Place in a Venue
* **Private Venues** - play spaces that have some privacy (i.e., at home). We can divide the home into three areas -- 
	* The "hearth" which is the more noisy, public area, 
	* The "workbench" which is for intense activities performed alone and with focus, and 
	* The "reading nook" for more quiet, relaxing places of solitude.
* **Public Venues** - play spaces out in public. These include
	* The "theatre" for more interactive, dramatic experiences
	* The "arena" for public competitions
	* The "museum" for play spaces that involve exploration and selection from a variety of choice "exhibits"
* **Half-Private / Half-Public** - play spaces that lie on the boundary between private and public. This includes playgrounds, gaming tables, and "anywhere" -- games played anywhere at any time.

### The Experience Rises Out of a Game
* The following definitions are only relevant in the realm of design. Defining various aspects of games allows us to gain insight into what it is we are designing.

* *Fun is [[Games as Play#Play of Pleasure|pleasure]] with surprises*. Games are fun. 
* *Play is manipulation that indulges curiosity*. We play because we are willing to indulge in play, and we do it for its own sake.
* *Games are problem solving activities approached with a playful attitude*. In a sense, all games are fundamentally [[Puzzle|puzzles]] and we get the satisfaction from having solved the puzzle.

### The Game Consists of Elements
* **Mechanics** - the [[Games as Rules|rules]] of the game that describe the goals, the constraints, and the outcomes. 
* **Story** - the [[Narrative|sequence]] of events that unfolds in the game
* **Aesthetics** -- how the game appeals to the sensation. 
* **Technology** - any materials and interactions that make the game possible. It allows the game to do certain things and not do others.

* All of the above are equally important and influence each other. All should work towards the same goal -- the player experience.
	* Never forget the player experience. Not knowing the elements makes us ignorant to how we can improve the experience, but not knowing the experience can make the game [[The Psychology of Everyday Actions|horrible]].
* Deficits in one element of the tetrad can inspire creative designs in another.
