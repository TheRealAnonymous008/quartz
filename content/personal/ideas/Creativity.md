# General Principles
* Design problems are really *design opportunities*, an opportunity to explore inherently imperfect solutions to the problem. 
* *Create what you, yourself would consume, use or find meaningful*. 

* Remember: *Artforms are nothing but substance* given meaning by humans. Strip away the meaning we imbue them and they are [[Stoicism|nothing]] but words on a page, or sounds, or pixels on a screen.
	* Thus, break creative works down to their simple parts. They are not complicated in so far as the ability to have a keen aesthetic sense and direction.
	* Art is good in so much as it fulfills or conveys something meaningful to the audience. 
* Remember: *There is no such thing as original*. 
	* The trick to making something "original" is to take inspiration, to learn the history of the craft.
	* *Understand the design decisions of others*. While [[The 48 Laws of Power#7. Get Others To Do The Work For You But Always Take The Credit|we may take inspiration from others]], when doing so take note of why those design or aesthetic decisions were made. [^7]
	* *Give me the same thing but different*. 
* *Inspiration comes from everywhere else*. Which is to say, we may imitate others but we cannot imitate inspiration. Inspiration comes from one's own perspective and how one applies that perspective to their art.  [^12]
	* Brainstorming tips are given [[Lenses for the Process#The Game Begins with an Idea|here]]. 
# The Process
## The Workflow
* The best way to get started is to *just start*. You needn't wait for inspiration to hit. Keep going by creating what you would enjoy.
* All creative endeavors benefit from an *iterative* design process [^3]. Drafts do not have to be perfect the first time around, and circumstances change. A creative output is as *emergent* as it is creative, and it is about both *inclusion and exclusion* [^10]
	* Design with intent in mind. 
	* An iterative approach: When the solution becomes unclear, ask a simpler question, again and again until a point of understanding is reached. 
* In actualizing a creative output, is natural and even preferred to start from *broad to specific* [^1] [^2])

## The Components
* Much of creative endeavors involves setting and responding to *expectations*-- that rooted in perceived and actual needs. To provide an experience for the audience is to play with their expectations:
	* Use **contrast** to highlight certain qualities. Play to the [[Availability Heuristic|salience bias]]. 
		* Beware too jarring a contrast.
	* Use **counterpoints** to highlight certain qualities. They respond to the aesthetic qualities of the piece.
		* Beware counterpoints that only cause clutter.
	* Use **[[Symbolism]]** to give more weight to the experience (see [[The 48 Laws of Power#37. Create Compelling Spectacles|here]]). 
		* Beware inappropriate, misaligned or offensive symbolism
	* Use **subversion** to supplement contrasts and respond to the appropriateness of the expectations themselves.
		* Beware subversions that are not set up properly.
	* Use **flow** to give the work a sense of motion and progress [^5].  
		* Beware flow that causes confusion or makes the piece disorienting.
	* Use **rigidity** to give the work a sense of strength and firmness [^6]. 
		* Beware rigidity that implies the work is boring or unengaging.
	* Use **perspective** to obstruct certain parts of the piece or to give a rich view that entices the imagination. Use **level of detail** (i.e., layers) to hide or show appropriate details that adds to the appreciation of the craft
		* Both techniques frame the user's experience with the piece. Multiple perspectives or levels of detail give richness and depth.
		* Level of detail also allows us to leave some things to the player and their imagination.
		* Additional tips are given in [[Lenses for the Game#Detail vs Imagination|here]]. 
	* For temporal art, use **pacing**. [[Framing Effect|Save the best for last]], control anticipation.
		* It is common in design to introduce cycles of tension and relaxation.
		* In particularly interactive media, pacing correlates to traversing the [[Flow State Model|flow channel]].

* Do not underestimate the *first principles* and *primitives* available to you. They are composable and give rise to rich expressions.
	* *Define* the design problem in terms of its primitives to understand the problem better.
	* There are three aspects that we may look at [^11]:
		* The *forms* that compose the product and how they interact with each other.
		* The *experience* the audience will have with the product.
		* The cultural *context* the product operates in. 

## Principles
* Learn to *kill your babies*. Do not become attached to a failing idea as this limits the potential of what is possible.  Some ideas do not belong in the work, despite how good they are. [^4] Design decisions meet a particular need 
* *Set limitations*. Limiting yourself encourages creativity (see [[Trade Offs#Freedom of Choice Trade-Off|here]] and [^8] [^10]). Design meets a particular need, not a universal need.
* *Less is more*. Bloat only makes the "special" elements look mediocre. *Less is a bore*. Add richness to the piece through appropriate detail. [[Trade Offs#Boring vs Overstimulating Tradeoff|Balance between the two philosophies as appropriate, while remembering the intent behind them]].
* *Break the rules* when needed, especially to stand out. Take bold, but calculated, risks [^9]
* *The whole is greater than the sum of its parts*. A piece is viewed as a whole, not just as a mish-mash of disjointed parts. A piece is viewed as part of the wider whole (its cultural context).
* *Respect the audience's time and intelligence* lest the creative work comes off as pretentious or dull.
