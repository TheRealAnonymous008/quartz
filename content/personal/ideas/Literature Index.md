* Agrippa (The Book of the Dead)

* **The Prayer for Loving Sorrow by Francis Jammes**

> I have nothing but my sorrow and I want nothing more. 
> It has been, it still is, faithful to me.
> Why should I begrudge it, 
> Since during the hours when my soul crushed the depths of my heart,
> it was seated there beside me?
> 
> O sorrow, I have ended, you see, by respecting you, 
> Because I am certain you will never leave me.
> Ah! I realize it: your beauty lies in the force of your being. 
> You are like those who never left the sad fireside corner of my poor black heart.
> 
> O my sorrow, you are better than a well-beloved: 
> Because I know that on the day of my final agony, 
> You will be there, lying in my sheets, O sorrow, 
> So that you might once again attempt to enter my heart.

* **In Flanders Fields by John McCrae**

> In Flanders Fields, the poppies blow
> Between the crosses, row on row
> That mark our place and in the sky 
> The larks, still bravely singing, fly 
> Scarce heard amid the guns below 
> 
> We are the dead. Short days ago. 
> We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow 
> Loved and were loved and now we lie, 
> In Flanders fields 
> 
> Take up our quarrel with the foe 
> To you from failing hands we throw 
> The torch; be yours to hold it high. 
> If ye break faith with us who die 
> We shall not sleep, though poppies grow 
> In Flanders fields
