* Those who donâ€™t know how to get people to say yes soon fall away; those who do, stay and flourish.

# Automatic Influence 
* There are three components to automatic influence
	* [[Thinking Fast And Slow|System 1]] is easy to fool, especially when it runs on preprogrammed mental shortcuts and when it runs with its own [[False Priors and Extension Neglect|stereotypes]] and [[Human Biases|biases]]. 
	* That most do not understand these automatic behaviors. Those that do understand will, therefore, have the advantage  
	* That those who execute it do so subtly with almost no effort. It is the ability to manipulate without the appearance of manipulation. 

## Reciprocation
* *Repay, in kind, what another person has provided; Give and Take and then Take*
* By giving you impose a sense of indebtedness in the recipient. Compliance follows from Obligation. 
	* Indebtedness overpowers Likability. [^rec1] If you feel indebted, you are more likely to repay it even if you do not like the person. 
	* Another person can trigger a feeling of indebtedness by doing us an uninvited favor. Hence it is not just our obligation to repay, but our obligation to receive the favor.
	* It can prompt unfair exchanges -- give a little and then take a lot more.  Conversely, because of pressures, people do not ask favors they are not in a position to repay.
	* *This rule applies more subtly*. We have an obligation to make a concession to someone who has made a concession to us.  We want to reciprocate the concession. 

* This rule has its roots in our evolution
	* Giving gives the promise that what is given will not be lost or wasted.  
	* It allows for establishing reciprocal relationships without loss.
	* The feeling of indebtedness is unpleasant and so we try to get rid of it by performing a larger favor.  There also exists the external pressure to repay unless we want to be labelled ungrateful. 
	* Our ability to concede is tied to compromising. Compromise ensures cooperation between two parties with different interests. Without conceding, we cannot take the first steps towards a negotiation. 

* This is why free samples and gifts are disarming and powerful. Even gifts that were unwarranted have bite as we cannot help but accept and repay.
* **Rejection-then-Retreat**. Offer a larger request that is likely to be turned down. Then, make a smaller request that you were aiming for all along. The second request is viewed as a concession. 
	* Research indicates that this tactic spurs people, not only to agree to the desired request, but actually carry it out and volunteer to perform further requests. 
	* The person facing the opponent who used the retreating strategy *felt more responsible for the final deal*. They felt that they controlled their opponent and got them to concede.
	* The person facing this strategy *felt more satisfied with the final arrangement*. 

[^rec1]: According to an experiment outlined in [[Influence -- The Psychology of Persuasion by Cialdini|Cialdini]]. 



## Commitment and Consistency
* *Once we have made a choice or taken a stand, we will encounter personal and interpersonal [[Logical Fallacy Biases|pressures]] to behave consistently with that commitment*.  Compliance follows from Commitment 
	* Once an *active* commitment is made, the self-image is squeezed from inside and outside to be consistent* 
		* There is the pressure to align self-image with action and 
		* There is pressure from outside to align self-image with perception.
	* *Public* commitments tend to be lasting commitments. There is additional pressure to be consistent with how others see us.
	* The more *effort* that goes into a commitment, the greater its ability to influence the attitudes of the person who made it.  [^com1]
	* A commitment is extra powerful when it convinces the person that *they own what they had done*. 
		* We accept inner responsibility for a behavior when we think we have chosen to perform it in the absence of strong outside pressures
		* Thus, instead of using a threat or being explicit, make things ambiguous so that the person convinces themselves that they did something because they wanted to.
		* The person may even find *new reasons* as to why they acted a certain way, even if these reasons are far from the truth. 

[^com1]: Hence why certain indoctrination rites such as hazing are effective and can bring loyal followers. The initiate convinces themselves they HAVE to be undergoing this treatment for something extraordinary.  

* We fool ourselves to [[Cognitive Dissonance|keep our thoughts and beliefs consistent with what we have already done or decided]]. 
	* For example: It would be awkward to suddenly be stingy when you have asserted that you are doing fine (even if it is only a part of sociable exchange)
	* People have a natural tendency to think a statement reflects the true attitude of the person who made it, even after they realize it was not a free statement. 

* In most circumstances consistency is important as it is associated with personal and intellectual strength. 
	* Blind consistency allows us to simplify things -- when things get confusing just stick to what is consistent to our earlier decisions. 
	* Sometimes it lets us avoid harsh realizations in the face of uncertainty. It offers a hiding space when we do not want to think about the implications of our beliefs. 

* **Foot-in-the Door Technique**. Start with a little request in order to gain eventual compliance with related larger requests.  
	* By getting them to accept the small request, they are already a co-conspirator. They will then desire to orient themselves to be consistent with that view. 
		* *Be careful about agreeing to trivial requests*. Such agreements increase the likelihood that we would commit to a larger request -- even those barely related.
	* *Written and Public commitments are powerful*. This could be to one's advantage (i.e., committing to a goal) or disadvantage (being coerced into one).
* **Lowballing** - An advantage is offered that induces a favorable purchase decision; then, sometime after the decision has been made but before the bargain is sealed, the original purchase advantage is deftly removed
	* The trick is to give the person new reasons to commit, even those far removed from the old reasons. 

* Such techniques are cost-effective. There is no need to undertake continuous effort to make sure the change continues. Simply getting people to commit is enough. 

## Social Proof 
* *One means we use to determine what is correct is to find out what other people think is correct*. Compliance follows from Uncertainty and Similarity
	* When we are unsure of ourselves, when the situation is unclear or ambiguous, we are most likely to look to and accept the actions of others as correct. 
	* Because everyone looks towards what everyone else is doing, there is an emergent consequence -- **pluralistic ignorance**.  [^socproof_1] [^socproof_2]
	* We will use the actions of others to decide on proper behavior for ourselves, especially when we view those others as similar to ourselves. [[Information Hazards]] abound.  [^socproof_3]

[^socproof_1]: A good example of this is the Bystander Effect. No one acts because of uncertainty about whether they should intervene, and because no one seems to be intervening, no one actually intervenes. 
[^socproof_2]: A good way to counteract this then is to dispel the uncertainty yourself. Point at someone in the crowd and ask them specifically for help. Then, with the uncertainty is dispelled, people will follow suit. 
[^socproof_3]: [[Influence -- The Psychology of Persuasion by Cialdini|Cialdini]] gives another example of this -- the [[Psychology|Wether effect]] and copycat suicides.  Imitation is key. This even extends to copycat acts of violence.

* Normally this works well because we will make fewer mistakes by acting according to social evidence. The heuristic that the way most people do it is right is indeed right. 

* *The trick, therefore, is to convince even a small sizable proportion of the group*. Then this conviction will spread to the rest of the group. 

## Liking 


## How to Say No 
* It is important to realize that the compliance techniques presented can be used for good or bad. 

* **Reciprocation**:  *Accept offers as they are, not how they are represented to be*. Another countermeasure: Simply accept the gift but don't reciprocate. 
* **Commitment**: *Recognize when commitment will lead to a poor choice*. The key is in two signals 
	* *The Gut-Feeling* - that something feels wrong and we know it. When the Gut says that something is wrong, explicitly point it out. 
	* *The Heart of Hearts* - that even if we don't know something is wrong, we need only to see that the commitment is not in line with our true beliefs.  "Knowing what I know now, Would I make the same choice again?" In this way we eliminate the "new" reasons we come up with to be consistent. 
* **Social Proof** - *Recognize when we have the wrong information*. Then take control instead of succumbing to social pressure.  i.e., two situations 
	* When the social evidence has been purposely falsified. Those that only aim to leave an impression. 
	* When an innocent, natural error snowballs into social proof pushing for incorrect decision. This arises when 
		* We assume that if a lot of people are doing the same thing, they must know something we don't. 
		* The crowd is mistaken because they are not acting on the basis of any superior information but are reacting 

# Debate 
* [Train for any argument with Harvard's Former debate Coach Bo Seo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WjUFuW2J0A) 
	* **RISA framework**. In a debate, ask yourself the following questions
		* Is it Real? 
		* Is it Important? 
		* Is it Specific enough? 
		* Are we Aligned in our beliefs?. 
	* Every disagreement should start with an agreed framework. Make explicit the intentions of the debate (I.e., what both sides are hoping to accomplish).
	* Pick and choose the arguments you respond to. The goal should be to make progress.
	* Empathize with the opposition. Understand where they are coming from.
	* Steelman argument -- respond to the strongest argument of the opposition.
