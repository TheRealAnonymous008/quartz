* $x\succeq y$ -  preference relation. $x$ is at least as good as $y$. 
* $x\succ y$ - strict preference relation. $x$ is strictly better than $y$.
* $x\sim y$ - indifference relation. $x$ and $y$ are equally good. 
* $u(x)$ - the payoff function over outcomes 
* $v(a)$ - the payoff function over actions
* $A$ - set of actions 
* $X$ - set of outcomes
* $a$ - generic action
* $x(a)$ - the outcome of action $a$
