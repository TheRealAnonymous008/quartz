* The main KPI's of manufacturing are Quality, Rate (i.e., throughput), Cost, and Flexibility (how easy it is to implement changes)
* The aim of manufacturing is to optimize the productive time of the entire assembly line 
  
  $$
  \begin{split}
  \text{Availability} &= \frac{\text{Total Hours Planned} - \text{Lost Time}}{\text{Total Hours Planned}} \\
  
  
  \text{Performance Rate} &= \frac{\text{Actual Machine Speed}}{\text{Design Machine Speed}} \\
  
  \text{Quality Rate} &= \frac{\text{Number of Good Products}}{\text{Products Made}}
  \end{split}
