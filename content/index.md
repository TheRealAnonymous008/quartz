title: The Library
---
The purpose of this Library is to archive and share my Second Brain to others. These notes were primarily written *for me*, but I figured that others can use these notes as well. [^1]

[^1]: If you see any formatting errors, please let me know. (Dataview tables are like that. I am awaiting a new push from quartz.)
# Knowledge Index
A broad listing of all the topics that I have made notes on. You can find more about the topics that I have deep dived on in this comprehensive [Skill Tree](https://whimsical.com/ontology-tree-Q29jMHUucE2kwACJfxrp1n) or on the explorer on the left.
