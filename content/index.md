title: The Library
---
The purpose of this Library is to archive and share my Second Brain to others. These notes were primarily written *for me*, but I figured that others can use these notes as well. [^1]

[^1]: If you see any formatting errors, please let me know. (Dataview tables are like that. I am awaiting a new push from quartz.)

# Overview
* I make notes on all things that I find interesting and that I have willingly committed to performing a deep dive on.
* All notes on knowledge are based on ideas, not my own ideas. Sometimes I provide some explanations that can help make it more intuitive to understand. 
* Ideas are presented as is -- as they are written or as how things are. The point is to organize things and find connections between ideas, even those that are seemingly disparate.

* *For future*: Personal notes are my own thoughts and syntheses of certain topics. Feel free to ignore these.
* Notes are organized in a directory structure corresponding to their broad categories. This is a fluid structure that is subject to change. Nevertheless, the search tool exists for a reason.

* Have an issue? Place one [here](https://github.com/TheRealAnonymous008/library-questions/issues)
# Knowledge Index
A broad listing of all the topics that I have made notes on. You can find more about the topics that I have deep dived on in this comprehensive [Skill Tree](https://whimsical.com/ontology-tree-Q29jMHUucE2kwACJfxrp1n) or on the explorer on the left. [^2]

[^2]: Styles based on how the [ABCs of Death Anthology](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-anthology-hub) were laid out.
