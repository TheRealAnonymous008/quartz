title: The Library

The purpose of this Library is to archive and share my Second Brain to others. These notes were primarily written *for me*, but I figured that others can use these notes as well. [^1]

# Overview
* I make notes on all things that I find interesting and that I have willingly committed to performing a deep dive on.
* All notes on knowledge are based on ideas, not my own ideas. Sometimes I provide some explanations that can help make it more intuitive to understand. 
* Ideas are presented as is -- as they are written or as how things are. The point is to [[Organizing Ideas|organize]] things and find connections between ideas, even those that are seemingly disparate. 
* However, note that just because ideas or concepts are included here doesn't mean I subscribe to the idea entirely. More applicable for topics that involve History, Social Sciences or just belief in general. 

* *For future*: Personal notes are my own thoughts and syntheses of certain topics. Feel free to ignore these.
* Notes are organized in a directory structure corresponding to their broad categories. This is a fluid structure that is subject to change. Nevertheless, the search tool exists for a reason.
* Research based sections are organized based on recency.
