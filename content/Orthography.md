* *Writing is a visible form of communication created by the hand, appealing to the eye, and consisting of signs that are assigned external referents*.

* *Real writing is compromise*, it is historic, and it is pragmatic. There is no perfect fit between the linguistic constructs that are functional in speech and writing, because writing is static while speech is dynamic
	* Writing and speech are distinct systems 
	* They are related in a variety of complex ways 
	* They have both shared and distinct functions 
	* The biomechanics for  their production and reception are different.

# Defining Writing
* *There is much debate about whether writing comes from oral language or vice versa*, as well as the role of writing in relation to language.

* **Aristotle** - Words spoken are symbols of affections or impressions of the soul (i.e., ideas); written words are symbols of words [[Phonetics|spoken]].
	* Writing is the act of forming signs for other signs (namely oral speech) as their referents. 
* **Liu Hsieh** - When the mind is at work, speech is uttered. When speech is uttered, writing is produced.
	* Writing has a creative analytic potential. Ideas can be expressed in either speech or writing and so writing is not necessarily fully dependent on speech. 
* **Plato** - Written words are unnecessary, except to remind him who knows the matter about which they are written 
	* Writing was not a substitute for speech because it was silent and lacked the intimacy of speech. 
* **Zen** - written words are useless
	* Writing creates distance between message and author / reader; it only relies on objectified knowledge rather than conscious experience.
* **Egyptians** - signs precede things. Creation is an act of articulation in the heart which finds expression in written signs first and then in speech. 
* **Massias** - It is this necessity of writing which gives its name to grammar, osteology and framework of discourse
	* Writing is at the heart of every language. There is only written speech.
* **Saussure** - *Language and writing are two distinct systems of signs*; the second exists for the sole purpose of representing the first. The linguistic object is not both the written and the spoken forms of words; the spoken forms alone constitute the object.
* **Geib** - writing is a means of expressing language. 
 
* Even though it is recognized as ‘only’ a representation of speech, its categories are allowed to intrude into [[Linguistics|linguistic]] inquiry - that which asks about he nature of language.

# Writing Systems 
* Broadly speaking there are two kinds -- those that are based on meaning or **semiography** and those based on sound or **phonography**. 
* *Writing is auto-indexical* in the sense that they reveal the procedures on the basis of which they must be used. It can be inferred how to decipher the text. 

* **Leibniz** - writing could be the root for a universal language that could facilitate logic, memory, and international communication. Doing this required that words correspond to things (concepts) independent of language. 
	* This is the foundation for a [[Philosophy|philosophical]] effort towards a universal language. 

* **van Helmont** - endeavored to translate graphemes to the positions of articulatory organs. 
	* This idea was present in the creation of Korean script from Chinese. *Letters imitated tongue positions during articulation*
	* In general, there is the notion that letters should correspond to [[Phonetics]]. 

* Writing and transcription are different. Writing is for readers who have little need for phonetic information. 
	* *Writing systems are conventionalized techniques of segmenting linguistic utterances in such away that the resulting units can be interpreted as linguistic constructs*. 
	* Transcription focuses on phonetics and phonology instead without regard for meaningful understanding. 
* A set of language symbols does not determine the nature of the writing system they are put to use. 

* **Principle of Autonomy of the Graphic System**: Writing systems are [[Syntax|structured]] and can therefore be analyzed in terms of functional units and relationships, and irrespective of other levels of linguistic structures. 
* **Principle of Interpretation** - writing systems are structured in such a way that they map onto two other levels of linguistic structure -- the phonetic, phonemic, [[Morphology|morphophonemic]] and lexical. These mappings are complex and imprecise. 
* **Principle of Historicity** - writing systems represent change in the language over time. 

* **Script** - pertains to the graphic form of the units of writing. 
* **Grapheme** - pertains to an abstract type of a letter and its position in a given writing system. 

# Signs 
* The **signary** pertains to the complete inventory of the basic signs of a given writing system. 
## Words 
* Words are the typical units of lexicology and lexicography. They are meaningful and can stand alone as a complete utterance.
	* Words have *positional mobility*. They can be taken out of context and arranged in lists. 
* However, what constitutes a word is highly debatable and not universal across other languages.
* The structural make-up of words depends on typological characteristics of languages.
	* In **isolating languages** words are invariant in that they do not undergo regular formal alterations that serve grammatical functions 
	* In **inflecting languages** words are changed to express grammatical relationships.
	* In **agglutinating languages** words are built up out of units expressing grammatical relations.
	* In **polysynthetic languages** it is difficult to distinguish words from other linguistic entities such as clauses and sentences. 

* The orthographic word is the *unit bounded by spaces in the written languages*. The phonological word is *the corresponding unit for speech*. 
* Words are not based on prior explicit linguistic knowledge. That is, *they came as written signs interpreted as words* which were then recognized as operational units of the writing system. 

* **Logographic Writing** - writing where the basic functional units are interpreted as words. 
	* **Sumerian** 
		* The beginning of Sumerian writing were pictures of objects in addition to geometrical forms (that came about as a result of stamping on the clay tablet)
		* The referents of the signs in the language are physical objects, but often they are inconsistent (a sign could refer to a bull, its horns, or just cattle in general)
		* Later developments included replacing curved lines with a series of short strokes, and the loss of the pictorial quality due to developing routines in writing.
		* In this case, recognition became based on discrimination from one sign to another.  The signs became more differentiated. Signs are made such that they are not confused from one another. 
		* More complex signs were formed by combining existing signs. 
		* The signs also acquired multiple readings which meant that reading became more difficult and supplementary signs were added for disambiguation.

* **Rebus writing** - Loss of the pictorial quality of the signs facilitated their transfer to semantically unrelated words

* **Ideographic Writing** - the basic functional unit is interpreted as an idea and meaning
