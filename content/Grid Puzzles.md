* Although they usually play in rectangular or square grids, most grid puzzles can generalize to non-rectangular grids.
	* Orthogonal simply means parallel to the edges of the cell.
	* Diagonal simply means a combination of two orthogonal movements.
* Many of these puzzles are published by Nikoli or Naoki Inaba.

### Arofuro
* *Goal*: Place arrows pointing in four directions in each empty cell.
- *Constraint*: Arrows that point in the same direction cannot be adjacent to each other orthogonally.
- *Constraint*: Starting from any cell with an arrow, we can trace a path to a numbered cell.
- *Constraint*: A cell with a number indicates a total number of arrows that leads to this cell.

### Every Second Turn
* *Goal*: Draw a single continuous non-intersecting loop that visits every cell exactly once.
* *Constraint*: It can make a 90 degree turn at every cell with a circle.
* *Constraint*: There is exactly one turn between two consecutive circles that the loop visits.

### Mobiriti
* *Goal*: Shade some cells on the grid.
* *Constraint*: Cells with circles cannot be shaded.
* *Constraint*: Numbers indicate how many empty cells can be reached from that cell moving orthogonally and without jumping over circled cells, blacked cells or itself.

### Mubunanba
* *Goal*: Separate the grid into regions.
* *Constraint*: Regions have exactly three cells in size.
* *Constraint*: Not all cells have to be part of a region.
* *Constraint*: Each region contains exactly one digit. 
* *Constraint*: Digits indicate the number of possible directions the block can move. Movement is orthogonal.
* *Variant*: **Mubunanba+** - allows for question marks as clues
	* Regions include exactly one digit or question mark, which represents an unknown digit.
	* All cells that are not part of any block must be connected orthogonally

### Terra X
* *Goal*: Place digits from $0,\dots,9$ into each region once
* *Constraint*: Regions with the same number cannot share an edge. They may touch at corners.
* *Constraint*: For each grid point where four regions meet, the sum of the digits equal ten. Grid points are marked on the grid.

### Rimotoeiji
* *Goal*: Connect all dots with a single continuous non-intersecting loop.
* *Constraint*: All crosses and arrows are contained within the loop.
* *Constraint*: Arrows point in the direction of the longest straight sequence of cells visible from that cell.
* *Constraint*: Crosses are placed at the center of more than one longest straight sequences of cells within the loop.
