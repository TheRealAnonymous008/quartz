* The following presents a list of puzzles alongside the general goal of the puzzle and any additional rules present.

# Dissection Puzzles
* Cut a shape into smaller shapes and re-arrange them to produce a particular pattern or geometric shape
	* *Extension*: Frame the problem as going from one shape to another shape while using:
		* The fewest / given number of cuts.
		* The fewest / given number of shapes 
	* *Extension*: Go from one shape to many smaller target shapes. Adding additional constraints (i.e., each smaller shape is the same size)
	* *Extension*: Go from many given shapes to one target shape.

* **Disappearance Puzzles** - arrange the geometric shapes in such a way that in the resulting shape, there is an apparent addition / subtraction of units. 
	* Alternatively, explain where the sleight of hand is in the disappearance

### Tangram-Like Puzzles
* **Tangram** - starting with a set of pieces of different shapes, assemble various figures based on their silhouettes. 
	* The STANDARD set is 5 triangles of varying sides + a square and a rhomboid.
		* *Extension*:  **Circular Tangram** - generalizes Tangram to use pieces that can have curved sides.
		* *Extension*: Use a different set of given shapes. 
		* Usually, though, the pieces can be assembled to form a basic shape (a square, circle, heart, egg, etc...)
	* The player is given a silhouette.
		* We can make it harder by obstructing the silhouette non-intrusively (adding stripes, for example).
		* Silhouettes can be abstract to representational, pertaining to people or objects. Sometimes even these objects may be given in place of the silhouette.
	* The player MUST use all pieces to assemble the figure.
	* In assembling, the pieces MUST touch without overlapping.

* **Polyforms** - Similar to Tangram except with the additional constraint that all pieces are identical or similar in some way. The goal is still to produce a similar shape.
	* **Polyomino problem** - a variant using a polyomino (usually a pentomino). Given a set of polyominos, cover the silhouette of the shape without the pieces overlapping.
	* *Extension*: Add a constraint where certain patterns may not be produced (for example, four polyominos may not touch at a corner).
	* *Extension*: Not just 2D shapes, but use 3D shapes too with varying thicknesses.
		* **Soma Cube Variants** - given a set of 3D polycubes (cubes assembled in a particular 3D shape), make a bigger cube (or a bigger shape) using all the pieces.

* **Matchstick Puzzles** - Similar to Tangram except with the additional constraint of all pieces corresponding to sticks (aka edges). The goal is still to produce some shape. 
	* *Extension*: We may only operate on a limited number of moves.
		* *Extension*: Move matchsticks to produce another configuration.
		* *Extension*: Remove matchsticks to produce another configuration.
		* *Extension*: Allow / Forbid matchsticks to be broken
	* *Extension*: The matchsticks are of different lengths.
	* *Extension*: Allow / Forbid matchsticks to cross.
	* *Extension*: The matchsticks must make a 3D structure that satisfies additional constraints.

### Miscellaneous Types
* **Domino Puzzles** - puzzles that involve the use of dominoes---defined as a piece consisting of two half-tiles. Each half tile has a number of pips on them.
	* *Variant*: Make a pattern given a set of dominoes such that half-tiles that touched each other had the same number of pips.
	* *Variant*: Make a pattern such that the "rows", "columns" or both satisfied an arithmetical constraint (i.e., same sums)
	* *Extension*: Whether or not to allow dominoes with blank half-tiles and how to handle them exactly.

# Mechanical Puzzles
### Construction Puzzles and Packing Puzzles

# Optimization Puzzles
* Applies to any of the puzzles above (or to new ones).

* Instead of being given the number of moves, find the optimal number of moves that still solve the problem.
* This also extends to tasks that are adjacent to [[Automata Theory|Automata]] or [[Instruction Set Architecture|Assembly]] wherein we want to minimize:
	* The number of instructions
	* The "space" occupied by the solution (analogues to memory or size for example).
	* The time it takes for some program to finish.
