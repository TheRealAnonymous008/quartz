* **Cox's Axioms** imply that for any mechanical system to represent beliefs, it must manipulate its beliefs based on the laws of probability.

* The **Principle of Insufficient Reason** states that one should use uniform distributions when there are no other reasons to favor one distribution over another.

* **[Luce's Choice Axiom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luce%27s_choice_axiom)** states that the probability of selecting one item over another from a pool of many items is not affected by the presence of absence of other items in the pool.

* The Frequentists see fixed parameters that define a sampling distribution from which observations are randomly sampled from.
* The Bayesians see observations as fixed, and the parameters as being determined randomly sampled from a distribution of parameters.
* It is more natural and optimal to be Bayesian than Frequentist.

* **Boole's Inequality** or the **Union Bound**. Let $A_1,\dots$ be a countable set of events. We have that $$P\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i\right)\le \sum_{i=1}^\infty P(A_i)$$
