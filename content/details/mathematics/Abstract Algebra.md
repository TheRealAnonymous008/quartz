* Abstract Algebra focuses on mathematical objects with certain structures.

# Topics
* [[Group Theory]] - tackles groups, defined as sets with an associated binary operator 
* [[Ring Theory]] - tackles rings, defined as sets with two associated binary operators -- addition and multiplication
* [[Field Theory]] - tackles fields, defined as rings where division is well-defined. 
* [[Linear Algebra]] - tackles vector spaces, defined as collections of elements from a field with a notion of linear combinations.
