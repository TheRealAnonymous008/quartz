* Differential Equations can be used to study processes that are deterministic, finite-dimensional, and differentiable. 
* The fundamental problem of the theory of differential equations is to determine or study the motion of some system using the [[Vector Field|phase velocity vector field]].  
* *Differential equations arise when the dynamics of a system is described by changes in state rather than explicit state values*. Analysis proceeds by transforming the problem into an analogous [[Geometry|geometric]] one in a vector field


# Ordinary Differential Equations
* An **integral curve** is a line that, at each point, is tangent to a vector field
  
  A necessary and sufficient condition for the graph of function $\varphi$ to be an integral curve is that the following relation hold for interval $I$ 
  
  $$
  \frac{d\varphi}{dt} = v(t,\varphi (t))
  $$
  The integral line lies in the direct product of the time axis and phase space (called the **extended phase space**)

* A function $\varphi : I \to U$ is a **solution** of the differential equation if $\forall t \in I$
  $$
  \frac{d\varphi}{dt} = v(\varphi(t))
  $$
  $\varphi$ satisfies the **initial condition** $(t_0, x_0)$ if $\varphi(t_0) = x_0$  
## Notation
* $t$ - time
* $x$ - element in phase space
* $(t,x)$ - extended phase space
