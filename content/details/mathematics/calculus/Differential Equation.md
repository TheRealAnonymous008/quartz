* *Differential Equations mathematically express the language of changing quantities* 
* Differential Equations can be used to study processes that are deterministic, finite-dimensional, and differentiable. 
* The fundamental problem of the theory of differential equations is to determine or study the motion of some system using the [[Vector Field|phase velocity vector field]].  
* *Differential equations arise when the dynamics of a system is described by changes in state rather than explicit state values*. Analysis proceeds by transforming the problem into an analogous [[Geometry|geometric]] one in a vector field
