*  $H\le G$ is **normal** if its left and right cosets coincide $\forall g\in G$ $$gH=Hg$$
* (*Fraleigh 14.13*) The following are equivalent conditions for $H\le G$ to be normal. $\forall g \in G$ and $\forall h\in H$, the following holds
	* $ghg^{-1}\in H$
	* $gHg^{-1}=H$
	* $gH=Hg$ 
	* $H$ is invariant under all inner automorphisms of $G$.
* A **maximal normal subgroup** of a group $G$ is a normal subgroup $M\ne G$ such that there is no proper normal subgroup $M< N\le G$
* (*Fraleigh 15.18*) $M$ is the maximal normal subgroup of $G$ if and only if $G/M$ is simple.
