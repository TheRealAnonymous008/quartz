* An **Abelian Group** is a group that is **commutative**. That is $\forall x, y\in G$ 
  $$x\ast y=y\ast x$$
  
* **Fundamental Theorem of Finitely Generated Abelian Groups**: Every finitely generated Abelian group $G$ is isomorphic to the direct product of the form 
  $$\mathbb{Z}_{(p_1)^{r_1}} \times \dots \times \mathbb{Z}_{(p_k)^{r_k}} \times \mathbb{Z}\times \dots\times \mathbb{Z}$$
  Where $p_i$ are primes, not necessarily distinct, and $r_i\in \mathbb{Z}^+$. 
  
  The direct product is unique except for rearrangement of the factors. The number of $\mathbb{Z}$ is a **Betti Number**. 

* (*Fraleigh 11. 15*) The finite indecomposable Abelian groups are exactly the cyclic groups of prime order. 
* (*Fraleigh 11.16*) If $G$ is a finite Abelian group, and if $m$ divides $|G|$, then $G$ has a subgroup of order $m$.
* (*Fraleigh 11.17*) If $m$ is a not divisible by the square of a prime number, then every Abelian group of order $m$ is cyclic.
* The **center** of a group $Z(G)$ is the Abelian subgroup of $G$ defined as 
  $$Z(G)=\{z\in G\mid zg=gz \space \space \forall g\in G\}$$
* Every Abelian Group is Normal.
