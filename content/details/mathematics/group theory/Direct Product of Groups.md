* The **direct product** of groups $G$ and $H$ is denoted $G\times H$ such that if $g\in G, h\in H$ then $(g,h)\in G\times H$ and also $(g_1,h_1)(g_2,h_2)=(g_1g_2, h_1h_2)$. 
* For Abelian Groups, the **direct sum** is simply the direct product, but is denoted as $G\oplus H$.

* (*Fraleigh 11.2*) The direct product of groups $G$ and $H$ is a group.
* (*Fraleigh e11.46*) The direct sum of two Abelian groups is Abelian. 
* Changing the order of the factors in a direct product yields a group isomorphic to the original one.

* (*Fraleigh 11.9*) If $(g,h)\in G\times H$ and $\text{ord}(g)$ and $\text{ord}(h)$ are finite, then 
  $$
  \text{ord}((g,h)) = \text{lcm}\left(\text{ord}(g), \text{ord}(h)\right)
  $$
  In general, if we have $(a_1,\dots,a_n)\in\prod_i^n G_i$ and $\forall i, \text{ord}(a_i)$ is finite, then
  $$
  \text{ord}((a_1,\dots,a_n)) = \text{lcm}(\text{ord}(a_1), \dots,\text{ord}(a_n))
  $$ 
  
* $G$ is **decomposable** if it is [[Group Isomorphism|isomorphic]] to a direct product of two proper nontrivial subgroups. Otherwise, it is **indecomposable**.
