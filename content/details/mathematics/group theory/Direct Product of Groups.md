* The **direct product** of groups $G$ and $H$ is denoted $G\times H$ such that if $g\in G, h\in H$ then $(g,h)\in G\times H$ and also $(g_1,h_1)(g_2,h_2)=(g_1g_2, h_1h_2)$. 
* For Abelian Groups, the **direct sum** is simply the direct product, but is denoted as $G\oplus H$.
* If $(g,h)\in G\times H$ and $\text{ord}(g)$ and $\text{ord}(h)$, then 
  $$\text{ord}((g,h)) = \text{lcm}\left(\text{ord}(g), \text{ord}(h)\right)$$
  
* $G$ is **decomposable** if it is isomorphic to a direct product of two proper nontrivial subgroups. Otherwise, it is **indecomposable**.
