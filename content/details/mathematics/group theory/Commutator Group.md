* Let $G$ be a group. An element $g\in G$ that can be expressed as 
  $$
  g=aba^{-1}b^{-1}
  $$
  is called a **commutator** in $G$.
* The subgroup $C\le G$ which consists of all commutators is called the **commutator subgroup** of $G$.
* (*Fraleigh 15.20*) The commutator subgroup is a normal subgroup of $G$. 
  
  If $N$ is a normal subgroup of $G$, then $G/N$ is Abelian if and only if $C\le N$.
