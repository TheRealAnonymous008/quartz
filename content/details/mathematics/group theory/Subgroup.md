* Let $G$ be a group. $H$ is a **subgroup** of $G$ if it is a group that is closed and contained within $G$. This is denoted as $H\le G$. 
* A **proper subgroup** is defined as a subgroup of $G$ that is not in itself $G$. This is denoted as $H<G$. Otherwise, we say $H$ is **improper**.
* (*Fraleigh 5.14*) A subset $H\subseteq G$ is a subgroup of $G$ if and only if the following hold: 
	* $H$ is closed under the binary operation of $G$.
	* If $e$ is the identity element of $G$, then $e\in H$.
	* $\forall x\in H$, $x^{-1}\in H$. 
* The intersection of subgroups is also a subgroup. 
* (*Fraleigh 10.10*) **Lagrange's Theorem** If $G$ is a finite group and $H\le G$, we have that $|H|$ divides $|G|$
* A subgroup $H\le S_A$ is **transitive** on $A$ if for each $a,b\in A$, there exists $\sigma\in H$ such that
  $$
  \sigma(a)=b
  $$
