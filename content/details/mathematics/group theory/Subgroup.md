* Let $G$ be a group. $H$ is a **subgroup** of $G$ if it is a group that is closed and contained within $G$. This is denoted as $H\le G$. 
* A **proper subgroup** is defined as a subgroup of $G$ that is not in itself $G$. This is denoted as $H<G$. Otherwise, we say $H$ is **improper**.

# General Properties
* (*Fraleigh 5.14*) A subset $H\subseteq G$ is a subgroup of $G$ if and only if the following hold: 
	* $H$ is closed under the binary operation of $G$.
	* If $e$ is the identity element of $G$, then $e\in H$.
	* $\forall x\in H$, $x^{-1}\in H$. 
* The intersection of subgroups is also a subgroup. 
* (*Fraleigh 10.10*) **Lagrange's Theorem** If $G$ is a finite group and $H\le G$, we have that $|H|$ divides $|G|$
* A subgroup $H\le S_A$ is **transitive** on $A$ if for each $a,b\in A$, there exists $\sigma\in H$ such that
  $$
  \sigma(a)=b
  $$
# Cyclic Subgroups
* A special subgroup is called the **cyclic subgroup**. Let $a\in G$, then $\braket{a}$ is the cyclic subgroup containing $a$.  It is defined as. 
  $$
  \braket{a}=\{a^n \mid n\in \mathbb{Z}\}
  $$
  We refer to $a$ as the **generator**. 
	*  It is the smallest subgroup containing $a$.
* In general, the smallest subgroup of $G$ containing all $a_i\in G$ is the **subgroup generated by** $\{a_i\}$. If this subgroup is all of $G$, then $\{a_i\}$ **generates** $G$, and each element is called a **generator**. If the set of $a_i$ is finite, then $G$ is **finitely generated**.
* (*Fraleigh 7.6*) The subgroup $H\le G$ generated by $\{a_i\}$ has elements, precisely those elements of $G$ that are finite products of integral powers of the $a_i$, where powers of a fixed $a_i$ may occur several times in the product.
