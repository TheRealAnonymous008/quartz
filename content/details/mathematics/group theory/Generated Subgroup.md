* A special subgroup is called the **cyclic subgroup**. Let $a\in G$, then $\braket{a}$ is the cyclic subgroup containing $a$.  It is defined as. 
  $$
  \braket{a}=\{a^n \mid n\in \mathbb{Z}\}
  $$
  We refer to $a$ as the **generator**. 
	*  It is the smallest subgroup containing $a$.
* In general, the smallest subgroup of $G$ containing all $a_i\in G$ is the **subgroup generated by** $\{a_i\}$. If this subgroup is all of $G$, then $\{a_i\}$ **generates** $G$, and each element is called a **generator**. If the set of $a_i$ is finite, then $G$ is **finitely generated**.
* (*Fraleigh 7.6*) The subgroup $H\le G$ generated by $\{a_i\}$ has elements, precisely those elements of $G$ that are finite products of integral powers of the $a_i$, where powers of a fixed $a_i$ may occur several times in the product.
