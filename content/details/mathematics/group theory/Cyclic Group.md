* A **Cyclic Group** is a group that is generated by an element $a$. That is all the elements in $G$ are of the form $a^n$, $n\in \mathbb{Z}$. We denote the cyclic group of order $n$ as  $\mathbb{Z}_n$. 

* (*Fraleigh e4.55 , Fraleigh 6.1*) Every cyclic group is an [[Abelian Group]].
* (*Fraleigh 6.6*) Every [[Subgroup]] of a cyclic group is Abelian 
* (*Fraleigh 6.7*) The subgroups of $\mathbb{Z}$ under addition are precisely the groups $n\mathbb{Z}$ under addition for $n\in \mathbb{Z}$. This allows us to define the **greatest common divisor**, which is the positive generator $d$ of the cyclic group
  
  $$
  H= \{nr + ms \mid n, m \in \mathbb{Z}\}
  $$
  under addition.
  $$
  d = \gcd(r,s)
  $$
  
* (*Fraleigh 6.10*) $\mathbb{Z}_n$ is [[Group Isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the integers under addition [[Number Theory|modulo]] $n$. 
* (*Fraleigh 6.10*) The infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to the integers under addition.  
* (*Fraleigh 6.14*) If $b=a^s$, then $\text{ord}(b)=n/d$ where $d=\gcd(n,s)$.  
* (*Fraleigh 6.16*) The generators of a finite cyclic group $G$ are of the form $a^r$, where $r\perp |G|$. ($r$ and $|G|$ are coprime)

* (*Fraleigh 10.11*) Every group of prime order is cyclic.
* (*Fraleigh 11.5*) The group $\mathbb{Z}_m\times \mathbb{Z}_n$ is cyclic and is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_{mn}$ if and only if $m$ and $n$ are coprime.
