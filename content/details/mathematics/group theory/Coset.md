* Let $H\le G$. 
  
  The **left coset** of $H$ containing $a$ is defined as 
  $$
  aH=\{ah \mid h\in H\}
  $$
  and the **right coset** of $H$ containing $a$ is defined as 
  $$
  Ha=\{ha\mid h\in H\}
  $$
  
* The cosets partition a group into equivalence classes.
	* More specifically the left coset expresses the equivalence relation 
	  $$
	  a\sim b\iff a^{-1}b\in H
	  $$
	  
	* The right coset expresses 
	  $$
	  a\sim b\iff ab^{-1}\in H
	  $$
	  
* Every coset of a subgroup $H\le G$ has the same number of elements as $H$.
* Let $H,K\le G$. 
  
  The **double coset** is the set defined as 
  $$
  HxK=\{hxh\mid h\in H, k\in K\}
  $$
  
	* This forms an equivalence class where $x\sim y$ if and only if there exists $h\in H$ and $k\in K$ such that $hxk=y$.
