* Let $(G,\ast)$ and $(H,\circ)$ be binary algebraic structures. A bijection $\phi: G\to H$ is an **isomorphism** if $\forall g_1,g_2,\in G$ $$\phi(g_1\ast g_2)=\phi(g_1)\circ \phi(g_2)$$We say $G\cong H$ (i.e., the groups are **isomorphic**).
	* It is a bijective homomorphism
* A **structural property** is a property that is preserved under isomorphism.
* (*Fraleigh 8.16*) **Cayley's Theorem**: Every group is isomorphic to a permutation group.
* An **automorphism** is an isomorphism of a group to itself.
	* The **inner automorphism** of $G$ by $g$ is defined as $$i_g(x)=gxg^{-1}$$Performing it is called the **conjugation** of $x$ by $g$
	  
	  A **conjugate subgroup** of $H$ is given by $$K=i_g(H)$$
