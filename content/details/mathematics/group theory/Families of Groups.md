* The **trivial group** is the group that contains only the identity element. This is denoted $\{e\}$.

* The **General Linear Group** is the group of $n\times n$ invertible matrices under matrix multiplication. It is denoted as $GL_n(\mathbb{R})$.
* The **Special Linear Group** is the group of $n\times n$ matrices whose determinant is $1$. It is denoted as $SL_n(\mathbb{R})$.

* The **Dihedral Group** of order $n$ is the group of symmetries of a regular $n$-gon which includes rotations and reflections. It consists to two generators $r$ and $s$ which correspond to rotation and reflection .It is denoted as $D_n$.
* The **Symmetric Group** of order $n$ is the group whose set is the set of all permutations of $n$ elements and whose binary operation is the composition of permutations. It is denoted as $S_n$.
* A **Permutation Group** is a group whose set consists of permutations and whose binary operation involves composing two permutations
