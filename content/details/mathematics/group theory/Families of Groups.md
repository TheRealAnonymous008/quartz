* The **trivial group** is the group that contains only the identity element. This is denoted $\{e\}$.
* The **Klein-4 Group**, denoted $V$ is a group defined by the following table

| $\ast$ | $e$ | a   | b   | c   |
| ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $e$    | $e$ | $a$ | $b$ | $c$ |
| $a$    | $a$ | $e$ | $c$ | $b$ |
| $b$    | $b$ | $c$ | $e$ | $a$ |
| $c$    | $c$ | $b$ | $a$ | $e$ |
* The **General Linear Group** is the group of $n\times n$ invertible [[Matrix|matrices]] under matrix multiplication. It is denoted as $GL_n(\mathbb{R})$.
* The **Special Linear Group** is the group of $n\times n$ matrices whose determinant is $1$. It is denoted as $SL_n(\mathbb{R})$.
* [[Abelian Group]]
* [[Cyclic Group]]
* The **Dihedral Group** of order $n$ is the group of symmetries of a regular $n$-gon which includes rotations and reflections. It consists to two generators $r$ and $s$ which correspond to rotation and reflection . It is denoted as $D_n$.
