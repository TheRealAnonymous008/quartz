* Let $\phi: G\to G'$ be a homomorphism and $H$ a normal subgroup of $G$. The **factor group** of $G$ modulo $H$, denoted $G/H$ is the group formed from the cosets of $H$ where 
  $$
  (aH)(bH)=(ab)H
  $$
  It has an isomorphism $\mu:G/H\to \phi(G)$ defined as 
  $$
  \mu(aH)=\phi(a)
  $$
  See (*Fraleigh 14.1, Fraleigh 14.4*) for a proof. 
	* In effect, this simplifies the group structure by representing all cosets with a representative element.
* (*Fraleigh 14.9*)  Let $H$ be a normal subgroup of $G$. Then $\gamma : G\to G/H$ where 
  $$
  \gamma(x)=xH
  $$
  is a homomorphism with kernel $H$.
* (*Fraleigh 15.8*) Let $G=H\times K$. Then, $\overline{H}=\{(h,e)\mid h\in H\}$ is a normal subgroup of $G$. Also, $G/\overline{H}\cong K$ in a natural way. Similarly, $G/\overline{K}\cong H$ in a natural way.
