* The **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus** states the following 
  
  Let $f$ be a continuous real valued function defined on a closed interval $[a,b]$. Let $F$ be the function defined $\forall x\in[a,b]$ by
  $$
  F(x) = \int_{a}^x f(t) \ dt
  $$
  Then $F$ is uniformly continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on the open interval $(a,b)$ and $F'(x)=f(x)$ $\forall x\in (a,b)$ 
  
  $F$ is the antiderivative of $f$ or
  $$
  \frac{d}{dx} \int_c^x f(t)  \ dt = f(x)
  $$
  
  Conversely, Let $f$ be a real-valued function on a closed interval $[a,b]$ and $F$ a continuous function on $[a,b]$ which is an antiderivative of $f$ in $(a,b)$
  
  $F'(x) = f(x)$
  
  If $f$ is Riemann integrable on $[a,b]$ then
  
  $$
  \int_{a}^b f(x) \ d(x) = F(b) - F(a)
  $$
  In simpler terms: *The integral and the derivative are inverses of each other*.
