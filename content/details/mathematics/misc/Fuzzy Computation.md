* **Fuzzy Logic** revolves around reasoning with vagueness. Unlike the case of [[Boolean Algebra]], truth can take on any number from $0$ to $1$.  That is, truth is [[Probability Theory|probabilistic]]. 
* If we consider a [[Set Theory|set theoretic]] analogue, under Fuzzy Logic, objects can be partially included in a set. 

* *Fuzzy computation allows smooth transitions between two sets of conditions*.
