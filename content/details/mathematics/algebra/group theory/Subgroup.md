* Let $G$ be a group. $H$ is a **subgroup** of $G$ if it is a group that is closed and contained within $G$. This is denoted as $H\le G$. 
* A **proper subgroup** is defined as a subgroup of $G$ that is not in itself $G$. This is denoted as $H<G$. Otherwise, we say $H$ is **improper**.

# General Properties
* (*Fraleigh 5.14*) A subset $H\subseteq G$ is a subgroup of $G$ if and only if the following hold: 
	* $H$ is closed under the binary operation of $G$.
	* If $e$ is the identity element of $G$, then $e\in H$.
	* $\forall x\in H$, $x^{-1}\in H$. 
* (*Fraleigh e5.54*, *Fraleigh 7.4*) The intersection of subgroups is also a subgroup. That is if
  $$
  H\le G \wedge K \le G \implies (H\cap K)\le G
  $$
* (*Fraleigh 10.10*) **Lagrange's Theorem** If $G$ is a finite group and $H\le G$, we have that $|H|$ divides $|G|$. 
	* *Intuition*: Every [[Cosets, Group Indices|coset]] contains the same number of elements as $H$, and the cosets partition $G$. Therefore, $|H|$ divides $|G|$ 
# Cyclic Subgroups
* A special subgroup is called the **[[Cyclic Group|cyclic]] subgroup**. Let $a\in G$, then $\braket{a}$ is the cyclic subgroup containing $a$.  It is defined as. 
  $$
  \braket{a}=\{a^n \mid n\in \mathbb{Z}\}
  $$
  We refer to $a$ as the **generator**. 
	*  (*Fraleigh 5.17*) It is the smallest subgroup containing $a$.
* In general, the smallest subgroup of $G$ containing all $a_i\in G$ is the **subgroup generated by** $\{a_i\}$. If this subgroup is all of $G$, then $\{a_i\}$ **generates** $G$, and each element is called a **generator**. If the set of $a_i$ is finite, then $G$ is **finitely generated**.
* (*Fraleigh 7.6*) The subgroup $H\le G$ generated by $\{a_i\}$ has elements which are precisely those elements of $G$ that are finite products of integral powers of the $a_i$, where powers of a fixed $a_i$ may occur several times in the product.

* A **Cayley Digraph** is a [[Directed Graph]] where each vertex corresponds to an element of $G$ and each edge $xy$, $x\in G, y\in G$ corresponds to $y=xa$ where $a$ is a generator of $G$. We overlay multiple such edge types for each element in some generating set $S$. 
* A Cayley Digraph necessarily and sufficiently satisfies the following properties.
	* The digraph is necessarily connected because every linear equation in the group has a solution.
	* The digraph has at most one arc from $g$ to $h$ because the solution $gx=h$ is unique.
	* Each vertex $g$ has exactly one arc of each type starting at $g$ and one arc of each type ending at $g$ because the products are unique. 
	* If two different sequences of arc types starting from $g$ lead to the same vertex $h$, then those same arc types starting from any vertex $u$ will lead to $v$. 
	  
	  If $gq=h, gr=h$, then $uq=ug^{-1}h=ur$
# Misc
* If $H,K\le G$ then we define
  $$
  HK = \set{hk\mid h\in H, k\in K}
  $$
* The **join** of  subgroups $H,K\le G$ is denoted $H\vee K$ and is defined as the intersection of all subgroups of $G$ that contain $HK$.
	* $H\vee K$ is the smallest subgroup of $G$ containing $HK$ as well as both $H$ and $K$.
