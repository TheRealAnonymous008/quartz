* An **Abelian Group** is a group that is **commutative**. That is $\forall x, y\in G$ 
  $$
  x\ast y=y\ast x
  $$
* For a subgroup $H$ of an Abelian group $G$, the partition of $G$ into left [[Cosets, Group Indices|cosets]] of $H$ and the partition of right cosets are the same. 


* **Fundamental Theorem of Finitely Generated Abelian Groups**: Every finitely generated Abelian group $G$ is [[Group Isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[Direct Product of Groups|direct product]] of the form 
  $$
  \mathbb{Z}_{(p_1)^{r_1}} \times \dots \times \mathbb{Z}_{(p_k)^{r_k}} \times \mathbb{Z}\times \dots\times \mathbb{Z}
  $$
  Where $p_i$ are primes, not necessarily distinct, and $r_i\in \mathbb{Z}^+$. 
  
  The direct product is unique except for rearrangement of the factors. The number of factors of $\mathbb{Z}$ is the unique **Betti Number** of $G$. 

* (*Fraleigh 11.15*) The finite indecomposable Abelian groups are exactly the cyclic groups of prime power order.
* (*Fraleigh 11.16*) If $G$ is a finite Abelian group, and if $m$ divides $|G|$, then $G$ has a subgroup of order $m$.
* (*Fraleigh 11.17*) If $m$ is a not divisible by the square of a prime number, then every Abelian group of order $m$ is cyclic.
* The **torsion subgroup** of Abelian group $G$ is the elements of finite order in $G$. It is denoted $A_T$ 
  
  An Abelian group is **torsion free** if $e$ is the only element of finite order 
  
  (*Fraleigh e11.43*) Every Abelian group is the direct product of its torsion subgroup and of a torsion-free subgroup. 


* Every Abelian Group is [[Normal Group|Normal]].

* The **center** of a group $Z(G)$ is the Abelian subgroup of $G$ defined as 
  $$
  Z(G)=\{z\in G\mid zg=gz \space \space \forall g\in G\}
  $$
* Another important normal subgroup is the [[Commutator Group]].
