* Let $V$ be a vector space and $T:V\to V$ be [[Linear Transformation]]. A [[Vector Subspace|subspace]] $W\le V$ is $T$-**invariant** if $T(x)\in W$ $\forall x\in W$. That is, $T(W)\subseteq W$
* The following are some $T$-invariant subspaces of $V$
	* $\{0\}$
	* $V$
	* $R(T)$ (see [[Dimension Theorem|here]])
	* $N(T)$
	* $E_\lambda$ for any eigenvalue $\lambda$ (see [[Eigenspaces and Eigenbases|here]]). 

* The subspace
  $$
  W = \text{span}(\set{x, T(x), T^2(x), \dots})
  $$
  called the $T$-**cyclic subspace** generated by $x$. [^cyclic_subspace]

	* The $T$-cyclic subspace generated by $x$ is the smallest $T$-cyclic subspace containing $x$. Any other $T$-cyclic subspace must contain $W$. 

[^cyclic_subspace]: Note the analogy to [[Subgroup#Cyclic Subgroups|Cyclic subgroups]]. Like cyclic subgroups, the $T$-cyclic subspace generated by $x$ is the smallest $T$-cyclic subspace containing $x$

* If $T$ is a linear operator on $V$ and $W$ is a $T$-invariant subspace of $V$, then the **restriction** $T_W$ of $T$ to $W$ is a mapping from $W\to W$ defined in a natural way (i.e., restricting the domain to be for $W$) 
	* (*Friedberg e5.4.7*) The restriction of a linear operator $T$ to a $T$-invariant subspace is a linear operator on that subspace.
	* (*Friedberg e5.4.23*) Let $T$ be a diagonalizable linear operator on finite dimensional vector space $V$ and let $W$ be a $T$-invariant subspace of $V$. Suppose $x_1,\dots,x_k$ are eigenvectors of $T$ corresponding to distinct eigenvalues. If $x_1+\dots + x_k\in W$ then $x_i\in W$ $\forall i$ . 
		* *Proof*:  This can be proven inductively. If $\forall j\le k-1$ we have $x_1 + \dots + x_{j}\in W$ and $x_i\in W$, $\forall i\le j$ we simply show that if $x_1+\dots + x_k\in W$ then $x_k \in W$. 
		  
		  By $W$ being a subspace
		  $$
		  \lambda_1 (x_1 +\dots + x_k) \in W
		  $$
		  By $x_1,\dots,x_k$ being eigenvalues and by $T$-invariance
		  $$
		  \lambda_1x_1 +\dots + \lambda_kx_k \in W
		  $$
		  Take the difference of these elements to get
		  $$
		  0\cdot x_1 + \dots + (\lambda_{k-1}-\lambda_{1}) x_{k-1} + (\lambda_k -\lambda _1) x_k \in W
		  $$
		  Now use the induction hypothesis on $k-1$ eigenvectors. Each of the terms in the sum are scalar multiples of eigenvectors so they are also eigenvectors. We get that $x_k\in W$. 

	* (*Friedberg e5.4.24*) The restriction of a diagonalizable linear operator $T$ to any nontrivial $T$ invariant subspace is also [[Matrix Diagonalization|diagonalizable]]
		* *Proof*: $T$ is diagonalizable. Any vector $x\in W$ can be expressed as a linear combination of the eigenvectors $x_i$ By (*Friedberg e5.4.23*)  these eigenvectors are all part of $W$. The restriction is defined in a natural way so the eigenvalues of $x_i$ in $T_W$ are the same as the one in $T$. (*Friedberg 5.4*) Then implies $W$ is diagonalizable.

* (*Friedberg e5.4.5*) The intersection of any collection of $T$-invariant subspaces of $V$ is also a $T$-invariant subspace.

* (*Friedberg 5.26*) Let $T$ be a linear operator on a finite dimensional vector space $V$ and $W$ be a $T$-invariant subspace of $V$. Then the [[Characteristic Polynomial|characteristic polynomial]] of $T_W$ divides the characteristic polynomial of $T$. 
* (*Friedberg 5.27*) Let $T$ be a linear operator on a finite dimensional vector space and $W$ denote the $T$-cyclic subspace of $V$ generated by $x\in V$. Suppose $\dim(W)=k\ge 1$ where $x\ne 0$. Then
	* $\set{x,T(x),\dots,T^{k-1}(x)}$ is a [[Linear Combination|basis]] for $W$. 
	* If $T^k(x)=-a_0x-a_1T(x)-\dots-a_{k-1}T^{k-1}(x)$, then the characteristic polynomial of $T_W$ is 
	  $$
	  f(t) = (-1)^k (a_0 + a_1t + \dots + a_{k-1}t^{k-1} + t^k )
	  $$

* (*Friedberg 5.29*) Let $T$ be a linear operator on a finite dimensional vector space $V$ and suppose $V=W_1\oplus\dots\oplus W_k$. (see [[Vector Sum and Direct Sum|here]]). where $W_i$ is a $T$-invariant subspace of $V$. 
  
  If $f(t)$ denotes the characteristic polynomial of $T$ and $f_i(t)$ the characteristic polynomial of $T_{W_i}$. Then
  $$
  f(t) = f_1(t) \cdot f_2(t) \cdot \dots \cdot f_k(t)
  $$
	* (*Friedberg e6.10.14*) Let $T$ be a linear operator on a finite dimensional vector space $V$ such that $V$ is a direct sum of $T$-invariant subspaces $W_i$. That is $V=W_1\oplus\dots\oplus W_k$. Then 
	  $$
	  \det(T)= \det(T_{W_1})\cdot \det(T_{W_2}) \cdot \dots \cdot \det(T_{W_k})
	  $$
* (*Friedberg e5.4.35*) Let $T$ be a linear operator on a finite dimensional vector space $V$ and suppose $V=W_1\oplus\dots\oplus W_k$ where each $W_i$ are nontrivial $T$-invariant subspaces of $V$. Then the [[Determinant]] is given by
  $$
  \det (T) = \det(T_{W_1}) \cdot \dots\cdot \det (T_{W_k})
  $$

* (*Friedberg Lem.6.39*) If $T$ is a linear operator on a nonzero finite dimensional real vector space $V$, then there exists a $T$-invariant subspace  $W$ of $V$ such that
  $$
  1\le\dim(W) \le 2
  $$
