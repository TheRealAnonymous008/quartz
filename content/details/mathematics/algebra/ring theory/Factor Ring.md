* (*Fraleigh 26.14*)  Let $N$ be an [[Ideal]] of a ring $R$. Then the additive [[Cosets, Group Indices|cosets]] of $N$ form a [[Fundamental Constructs of Ring Theory|ring]] $R/N$ with binary operations defined by
  $$
  \begin{split}
  (a+N) + (b+N) &= (a+b) + N\\
  (a+N) \cdot (b+N) &= (ab) + N
  \end{split}
  $$
  We call $R/N$ the **factor ring** (a.k.a **quotient ring**) of $R$ by $N$.

* (*Fraleigh 26.16*) Let $N$ be an [[Ideal]] of the ring $R$.  Then $\gamma:R\to R/N$ given by $\gamma(x)=x+N$ is a [[ring homomorphism]].
  
  Also $\text{Ker}(\gamma)=N$.

* (*Fraleigh e26.24*) A factor ring of a [[Field]] is either the trivial zero ring of one element or is isomorphic to the field.

* (*Fraleigh 27.15*) Let $R$ be a [[Commutative Ring]] with [[Ring with Unity|unity]] and let $N\ne R$ be an ideal in $R$. Then $R/N$ is an [[Integral Domain]] if and only if $N$ is a prime ideal in $R$.

* A **simple ring** is a ring that is nontrivial and contains no proper nontrivial ideals
	* (*Fraleigh e27.29*) $N$ is a maximal ideal in $R$ if and only if $R/N$ is a simple ring.
