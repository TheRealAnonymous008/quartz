* A ring is **non-commutative** if multiplication is not necessarily commutative. 
* The set $\text{End}(A)$ of all [[Group Homomorphism|endomorphisms]] of an [[Abelian Group]] $A$ forms a [[Fundamental Constructs of Ring Theory|ring]] where addition is homomorphism addition and multiplication is homomorphism composition
  $$
  \begin{split}
  (\phi+ \psi)(a) &= \phi(a) + \psi(a) \\
  (\phi\cdot \psi)(a) &= \phi(\psi(a))
  \end{split}
  $$
  We call this ring the **Endomorphism Ring**.
  
  An Endomorphism ring need not be commutative.

* A [[Group Ring]] is not necessarily commutative. In fact if $G$ is not Abelian, then the group ring is not commutative.

* The [[Complex Numbers and Quaternions|Quaternions]] give a noncommutative [[Division Ring and Rings with Unity|division ring]] under addition and multiplication.
  
  In fact (*Fraleigh 24.9*) They form a strictly skew field
