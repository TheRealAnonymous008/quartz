* A **commutative ring**  is a [[Fundamental Constructs of Ring Theory|ring]] where the multiplication operation is commutatiive.

* In a ring with unity $1$, the distributive laws show that for $n,m\in \mathbb{Z}$
  $$
  (n\cdot1)(m\cdot1) = (nm)\cdot1
  $$

* (*Fraleigh e18.38*) In a commutative ring:  
  $$
  a^2-b^2=(a+b)(a-b)
  $$
  In fact, the converse is also true if $\forall a, b\in R$ the above holds, then the ring is commutative 
* In a commutative ring, the usual binomial expansion for $(a+b)^n$ holds
* (*Fraleigh e18.44a*) The set of all idempotent elements in a commutative ring is closed under ring multiplication
* (*Fraleigh e18.46*) If $a$ and $b$ are nilpotent elements of a commutative ring, then $a+b$ is also nilpotent 
  
  In fact if $\exists n,m\in \mathbb{Z}^+$, such that $a^n=b^m=0$. Then $(a+b)^{n+m}=0$
