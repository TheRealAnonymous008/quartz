* An additive [[Subgroup]] $N$ of a [[Fundamental Constructs of Ring Theory|ring]] $R$ is called an **Ideal** if it satisfies $\forall a,b\in R$
  $$
  \begin{split}
  aN\subseteq N\\
  Nb \subseteq N
  \end{split}
  $$
  This is analogous to the formulation for [[Normal Group|normal groups]]. 

* (*Fraleigh e26.22*) Let $N$ be an ideal of $R$ and $\phi:R\to R'$ a [[Ring Homomorphism]]. Then $\phi(N)$ is an ideal of $\phi(R)$ although it need not be an ideal of $R'$
  
  Also if $N'$ is an ideal of either $\phi(R)$ or $R'$, then $\phi^{-1}(N')$ is also an ideal of $R$.
