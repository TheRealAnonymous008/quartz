* An additive [[Subgroup]] $N$ of a [[Fundamental Constructs of Ring Theory|ring]] $R$ is called an **Ideal** if it satisfies $\forall a,b\in R$
  $$
  \begin{split}
  aN\subseteq N\\
  Nb \subseteq N
  \end{split}
  $$
  This is analogous to the formulation for [[Normal Group|normal groups]]. 

* Every nonzero ring $R$ has at least two ideals -- the **improper ideal** $R$ and the trivial ideal $\{0\}$

* (*Fraleigh e26.22*) Let $N$ be an ideal of $R$ and $\phi:R\to R'$ a [[Ring Homomorphism]]. Then $\phi(N)$ is an ideal of $\phi(R)$ although it need not be an ideal of $R'$
  
  Also if $N'$ is an ideal of either $\phi(R)$ or $R'$, then $\phi^{-1}(N')$ is also an ideal of $R$.

* (*Fraleigh e26.27*) The intersection of ideals of ring $R$ is also an ideal of $R$. 

* A **maximal ideal** of a ring $R$ is an ideal $M\ne R$ such that there is no proper ideal $N$ of $R$ properly containing $M$.

* (*Fraleigh 27.9*) Let $R$ be a [[Commutative Ring]] with [[Ring with Unity|unity]]. Then $M$ is a maximal ideal of $R$ if and only if $R/M$ is a field

* An ideal $N\ne R$ in commutative ring $R$ is a **prime ideal** if 
  $$
  ab\in N \implies a\in N \vee b\in N
  $$
	* The motivation behind this definition is that the factor ring $R/N$ will be an [[Integral Domain]] if and only if 
	  $$
	  (a+b)(b+N)=N\implies a+N=N \vee b + N = N
	  $$
	  That is $R/N$ has no divisors of $0$.

* (*Fraleigh 27.16*) Every maximal ideal in a commutative ring $R$ with unity is a prime ideal.
* (*Fraleigh e27.24*) For a finite commutative ring with unity $R$, every prime ideal is a maximal ideal. 

* If $R$ is a commutative ring with unity and $a\in R$, the ideal of all multiples of $a$ is called the **principal ideal generated by $a$** defined as 
  $$
  \braket{a} = \set{ra \mid r\in R}
  $$
  An ideal is called a **principal ideal** if $N=\braket{a}$ for some $a\in R$.
	* Every ideal of $\mathbb{Z}$ is a principal ideal.

# Radicals
* An element $a$ of a ring $R$ is **nilpotent** if $a^n=0$ for some $n\in \mathbb{Z}^+$
	* (*Fraleigh e18.47*) A ring has no non-zero nilpotent element if and only if $0$ is the only solution to $x^2=0$ in $R$.
	  
	  Trivially, it is easy to see the case where the $x^2=0$ for some $x\ne 0$ gives a non-zero nilpotent element.
	  
	  For the converse, suppose $x^2\ne 0$, but $x^p=0$. Then we can consider $x^2,x^4,\dots, x^{2^{\lg p}}\ne 0$,    
	* We refer to the set of nilpotent elements of ring $R$ as its **nilradical**. 
	* (*Fraleigh e26.30*) The nilradical is an ideal.

* (*Fraleigh e26.30*) The nilradical of $R$  forms an ideal in $R$. 

* Let $R$ be a commutative ring and $N$ an ideal of $R$. The **radical*** of $N$ is defined as
  $$
  \sqrt{N} = \set{a\in R\mid a^n\in N \text{ for some } n\in \mathbb{Z}^+}
  $$
	* (*Fraleigh e26.34*) The radical is an ideal of $R$.
	* Let $N$ be an ideal in $R$, Then the nilradical of the [[Factor Ring]] $R/N$ is the factor ring of the radical $\sqrt{N}/N$
