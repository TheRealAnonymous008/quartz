* A **field** is a [[Commutative Ring|commutative]] [[Division Ring and Rings with Unity|division ring]]. 

* (*Fraleigh 19.9*) Every field is an [[Integral Domain]]
* (*Fraleigh 19.11*) Every finite integral domain is a field
	* *Proof*: Let $D$ be an integral domain whose elements are $0,1,a_1,\dots, a_n$. 
	  
	  All elements in $D$ of the form $a1,aa_1,\dots,aa_n$ are distinct because of the cancellation laws. Also, none of these elements is $0$. Therefore, we can map these to $1,\dots,n$ (i.e., $aa_i=1$ for some $a_i$).
* (*Fraleigh 19.12*) If $p$ is [[Number Theory|prime]], then $\mathbb{Z}_p$ is a field

* A **subfield** of a field is a subset of the field that is afield under induced operations from the whole fiield. It is a generalization of [[Subgroup]]. 
	* (*Fraleigh e18.49b*) The intersection of subfields of a field$F$ is again a subfield of $F$

* The nonzero elements form a [[Fundamental Constructs of Group Theory|group]] under the field multiplication
