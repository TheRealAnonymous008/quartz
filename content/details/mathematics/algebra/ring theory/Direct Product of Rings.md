* Let $R_1,\dots, R_n$ be [[Fundamental Constructs of Ring Theory|rings]]. The **direct product** is denoted $R_1\times R_2 \times \dots \times R_n$ of all ordered $n$-tuples $(r_1,\dots,r_n)$ where $r_i\in R_i$.
  Addition and multiplication is defined component-wise (see below) and hence *the direct product of rings is a ring*.  
  
  $$
  \begin{split}
  (r_1,\dots, r_n) + (s_1,\dots,s_n) &= (r_1 + s_1 ,\dots,r_n + s_n) \\
  (r_1,\dots, r_n) \cdot (s_1,\dots,s_n) &= (r_1s_1 ,\cdots, r_ns_n) 
  \end{split}
  $$

* The direct product of rings is [[Commutative Ring|commutative]] if and only if each $R_i$ is commutative.
* The direct product of rings has unity if and only if each $R_i$ has unity
