* $\Omega$ - set of interest for measure theory (we may refer to it as the sample space)
* $A,B$ - subsets of the sample space.
* $\mathcal{A},\mathcal{B}$ - families of subsets.
* $\inf_{k=n} A_k$  - infimum of sequence of sets.
* $\sup_{k=n}A_k$ - supremum of sequence of sets
* $\lim_{n\to\infty} B_n = B$ - $B$ is the limit of the sequence of sets $B_n$. 
* $B_n\to B$ - $B$ is the limit of the sequence of sets $B$.
* $\text{ i.o.}$ - infinitely often
***
* $A_n\nearrow$ - monotonically non-decreasing
* $A_n\uparrow$ - strictly non-decreasing
* $A_n\searrow$ - monotonically non-increasing
* $A_n\downarrow$ - strictly non-increasing
