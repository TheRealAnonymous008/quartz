* In learning Mathematics, prioritize understanding the definitions first using examples if needed. Then, understand what the theorems are saying. Finally, understand the proofs on why a theorem should be true (analogous to the [[Reading#Three Pass Approach|three pass approach]])

* [The Ansatz Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansatz) pertains to solving a problem using an educated guess or assumption  about the solution which may later be verified to be part of the solution.

* A quaternion $w+xi+yj+zk$ can be represented as the rotation corresponding to 
  $$
  \cos{\left(\frac{w}{2}\right)} + \sin{\left(\frac{w}{2}\right)}(x\hat{i}+y\hat{j}+z\hat{k})
  $$

* **Jensen's Inequality** states that for any convex function 
  $$
  f\left(\sum_{k=1}^n \lambda_ix_i\right)\le
  \sum_{k=1}^n\lambda_i f(x_i)
  $$
  Where $\lambda_i\ge 0$ and $\sum_{k=1}^n\lambda_i = 1$.
  
  An alternative formulation is that if we have convex function $f$ and a random variable $X$, we have 
  $$
  f(\mathbb{E}[X])\le \mathbb{E}[f(x)]
  $$
  That is, the output of the average input from $X$ is smaller than the average output from $f(X)$.
