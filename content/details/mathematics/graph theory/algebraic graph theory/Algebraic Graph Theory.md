* An extension of [[Graph Theory]] that combines insights from [[Linear Algebra]], [[Group Theory]], and [[Ring Theory]]. 

# Results
* (*Mesbahi 2.7*) Given a weakly connected digraph $D$, the [[Dimension Theorem|null space]] of $B(D)$ is spanned by all [[Linear Combination|linearly independent signed path vectors]] corresponding to the [[Trails, Walks, Paths and Cycles|cycles]] of $D$.
	* The **cycle space** of a digraph is defined as $N(B(D))$, that is the [[Dimension Theorem|null space]] of the associated incidence matrix.
	* The **cut space** of a digraph is defined as $R(B(D)^T)$, that is the [[Orthogonality and Orthonormality|orthogonal complement]] of the cycle space.
