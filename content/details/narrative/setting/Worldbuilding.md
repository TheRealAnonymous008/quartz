#  Sanderson's Laws
* *Motivation*: Some stories feel like they cheat with their worldbuilding. That is, they feel like plot contrivances and deus ex machina.
* Note: These are not actually laws, they are rules for a particular style result.
### Law 1
* *Your ability to solve problems with "magic" in a satisfying way is directly proportional to how well the reader understands said magic*

* Inventing new systems at the halfway point just to bail the characters out of the conflict, thus, feels like cheating.
* There is a continuum with regards to magic. On one end is a sense of wonder with magic, and on the other, magic-esque science (that is magic with pre-defined rules). 
	* As you move towards the magic-esque science side of the spectrum you lose the sense of wonder given by thee magic system.
	* As you explain the rules, you define the toolset that the characters have under their belt. 
* There are two types of magic:
	* *Soft Magic* involves magic where the rules are not entirely known to the users or the reader.
	* *Hard Magic* involves magic with a well-defined rules.
	* Hard and Soft Magic can coexist.
* This rule is a rule of *foreshadowing*. That is, *the audience could have figured out what will happen*.
### Law 2
* *Flaw or limitations are more interesting than powers*. 

* In developing a magic system, developing the flaws, limitations, and costs of these powers leads to interesting stories.
* The severity of the cost can be used to control how often we would like the characters to use the magic system.
* If the limitations are contrived, the audience will question the validity of these limitations. The limitations should feel natural and explained sufficiently.
### Law 3
* *Before adding something new to your setting, see if you can instead expand what you have*.

* Less is more. Bigger settings are not always better.
* Having 10 worldbuilding features is better than having 10,000 features.
* The audience will latch on a deep idea rather than multiple shallow ideas
* Most notably, while we may be tempted to make a very deep world, pragmatically we can develop the depth just enough to give the illusion of depth (but not to the point the story becomes shallow).
* Do the bare minimum that is necessary in worldbuilding and no more.
### Law 0:
* *Always err on the side of what is awesome*.

* Start the premise of your story with something very interesting for you and the reader.
# Some Tips
* Remember: The goal is to make a good story. *Worldbuilding is a means to an ends to tell a story in an interesting way.*
* Convery worldbuilding through the characters and the plot. Avoid the info-dump or the encyclopedia entry.
	* Instead have the worldbuilding come out through the dialogue. 
		* Caveat: Avoid **maid-and-butler dialogue** where the characters talk about things they should already know for the sake of exposition for the reader.
	* Give less worldbuilding than needed. Give the audience the opportunity to fill in the blanks.
		* Ground the audience in a firm, concrete foundation so that the more high level things do not feel like a manifestation of the author's hand.
		* *[[General Story Writing Principles#Exposition|Show don't tell]]*, but use [[Technical Writing Mistakes|less filler words]]. 
		* Ground the audience by showing them a concrete example of your more abstract ideas.
* Worldbuilding can be divided into two kinds:
	* **Physical** - pertaining to objects that can exist on their own without people.
	* **Cultural** - pertaining to products of culture (i.e., people)
	* There are many aspects of worldbuilding. *Realistically, it is not possible to depict all of this*.
	* Highlight the interesting things of the world, and then how they impact the culture of the world.
	* Importantly, have everything *be interconnected*. Run with the logical consequences of the core focus of the worldbuilding.
