* Consider the scale of the map -- does everyone in the world know (roughly) all the places in the map or not? 

* Consider the *shape of the landmasses* and the proportion of landmasses to the water. 
	* A way to [[details/creativity/design/DOET/Design Thinking|Prototype]] the shape of the coastline is using something malleable [^1]
	* Take real world maps and coastlines and then rotate them around. This has the advantage of having realistic coastlines. 

* Consider the *plate tectonics* 
	* *Rule of thumb*: The fault lines should not meet in corners (that is, no crosses)
	* Since the planet is a sphere, the right and the left drawing of the fault lines (when projected onto 2D) should match up.
	* Place the landmasses (generally) on the continental plates, and the water on the oceanic plates. Not all of the plate needs to be covered with land / water. 
	* *Rule of thumb*: There is one section between oceanic plates where they diverge, and one section between continental plates where they converge (of course plates can rotate).
		* This can be plotted out by considering how the plates move.
	* Consider the plate boundaries (convergent, divergent and transform)
	* Consider the placement of hotspots -- these can occur anywhere on the plate  
		* In the ocean, these will form volcanic island chain. 
		* On land these will form calderas

[^1]: WASD20 recommends using beans, but you can easily do this with anything that lets you sculpt (or example [[Pixel Art]]).

* Consider the [[Winds and Atmospheric Kinetics]], specifically the different wind speeds and the regions of wind. These affect the local climate -- and by extension the biomes that can grow. 

* Consider the placement of *mountains*
	* Mountains form at the boundary of convergent plates 
	* The locations of mountain ranges affect travel. For example, a mountain range can cut a continent in two halves and people from two halves will find it hard to communicate.

* Consider the placement of *water* 
	* Rivers flow generally from the mountains to sea. Consider how [[Gravity]] operates.
	* Rivers generally do not split, they join. (splitting is rare, but it can happen in deltas, for example).
