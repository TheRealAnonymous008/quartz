# Vocabulary
* **Three Dot Approach** - if a word appears at least three times in a short amount of time in the passage, it is probably an important word.
* Decompose words based on their apparent [[Etymology]] to understand their meaning.
* Use Context Clues to understand the meaning of a word based on its context (i.e., via synonyms, antonyms, use of examples, specific situations, or emotions and general tone of the passage). 
* Remember, reading becomes more understandable when you understand the context of what the text is saying.
# Getting Better at Reading
* Each paragraph tends to have a point, a main idea or thesis, either directly stated or implied in the passage, that is elaborated on by other supporting sentences. *Ask yourself what the author wants to get at with the text? What is the purpose of the text? to entertain? instruct? persuade?*.

* Consider the following three skills for understanding and remembering a passage.
	* **Annotating** 
		* It helps the reader engage in more *active reading*, not simply passively engaging with the text hoping to understand it in one reading.
		* Take note of the main ideas, questions you have about the passage, and ideas you disagree with.
	* **Paraphrasing** 
		* It means to *restate the writer's words in your own words*.
		* It forces understanding of the contents of each sentence in the text.
	* **Summarizing**
		* It means to *convey the most important information* about the text. 
		* It forces understanding of the text by letting you comprehend the big picture of what the passage is trying to say.

* *Read between the lines*. Infer what the author implicitly suggests through the text. Note, use the text as the basis for inference, not your own biases about the text.
	* Inference requires understanding of the surface-level meaning of the text.
	* Remember that *inferences are statements of probability, not facts*. They proceed from facts, but are not [[Bayesian Statistics|facts]] themselves.

* Recognize different **patterns of development**, the internal logic of a passage used to convey an idea.
	* **Listing facts or details** - supporting sentences present factual evidence to support the main idea.
	* **Examples** - a specific instance of something more general.
	* **Cause and Effect** - supporting sentences answer the question "why?" an effect happens.
	* **Description of a process** - the sentences describe "how" to perform something.
	* **Contrast** - two subjects are set side by side to examine their differences.
* Recognize different **transitional elements** or **markers** which make the logical relationships between ideas clear. Each pattern of development is marked by a transitional element.
	* Actively think about the logical connections between sentences.

* Consider the author's opinion, especially when they are trying to persuade through their writing.
	* Keep in mind the aim of the opinion piece. Remember, that the author's subjective opinions are on display. 
	* Consider the author's central proposition or **claim**. 
		* **Claims of fact** - are those verifiable through factual evidence or scientific research.
		* **Claims of value** - involve matters of taste, [[morality]], and opinion supported through reasoning.
		* **Claims of policy** - argues for a recommended policy (what "should" be done).
	* Consider the **evidence** used to support the claim. These include facts and statistics, examples and observations, reasoning, and testimony from experts.
	* Look for a **refutation** where the author deals with the opposing side, often giving a counterargument. *Good authors consider the other side of the argument and offer a rebuttal*
	* Look for [[Human Biases|biases]] that are present within the piece.

* Depending on the type of the passage (essay, short story, novel, etc), we should be *flexible* and read them differently, appropriately, and with an intent in mind.
* Remember: *writers are in no obligation to make their work easier to read*. 
# Three Pass Approach
* Read in three passes:
	* **Skim** through the reading to get a high level understanding of what the topic is about.
	* **Dive** through the whole reading in detail. Be prepared to answer questions you may have while reading with more reading.
	* **Summarize**  the  reading in your own words. Explain it simply.
