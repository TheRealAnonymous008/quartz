# Filler Words
* Most words do not add anything new to the sentence. Avoid filler words.
* Most adverbs are superfluous and make writing seem amateurish. Use with discretion.
	* adverbs are better if you have: `do X in a Y way`. Simply say `do X Y-ily`.
	* prefer not to start a sentence with an adverb.
* `very / really` - avoid using this! 
* `that` - most of the time it is another filler word! 
* `essentially / basically / just/ simply / clearly / pretty much` - gives off either a pretentious or reductionist tone.  
* `obviously / everyone knows` - also gives off a pretentious tone. Avoid using. 
* `more / less / most / least / also` -these should only be used with respect to another statement, not on their own.
* `be`  -use only when pertaining to the act of being in a certain state. Otherwise, replace with an appropriate adverb or verb.
* `able to <verb>` - use `can <verb>` instead.
* `x of y` - check if it is possible to say `y x` or `y's x`. 
* `something / sort of / kind of` - check if it is possible to be more specific.
* `in general` - use `generally`. Use only when generalizing.
# Brevity and Tone
* Write short. Cut unnecessary words.
* Run-on sentences. If the sentence has `which`, or conjunctions such as `and / or / but`, see if it can be broken into two sentences.
* Write in a natural (usually conversational) tone. [Write Like You Talk](http://www.paulgraham.com/talk.html).
* Use the active voice over the passive voice. 
	* Exception: use passive voice if the subject is less important than the action.
	* Exception: use passive voice when there is uncertainty.
# Clarity
* Beware of `it/they`, `this/these/that`, and other pronouns. Make sure that what the pronoun is referencing is unambiguous, and the choice of pronoun makes sense.
* Place adverbs close to their corresponding verb. This makes the writing clearer.
# Others
* The word `data` is plural
* When the phrase inside the parenthesis is actually a sentence, prefer to remove the parentheses and use commas instead.
