* The following framework gives an idea for why the audience may like characters.
* One of the best ways to make characters feel real is to not write them to a role. They should not just be set dressing.
	* The less time you give to the character, the more likely you will write them to a role.
	* *Remark*: Aim to make it satisfying to observe the character's behavior and especially changes in their behavior. 

* *Every character sees themselves as the main character of their own stories*.
* *Character background defines how they speak, think, act and see the world*. 
	* A good way to do is is through [[Dialogue|Dialogue]]
	* A good character is one the audience believes would actually make the decisions they make in the story. Thus, remember: *characters drive plot, through their believable decisions.* 
	* **Backstory** means the important events that shape the character's life. *Landscape character biographies such that they will give background to interesting events in their life*.
	* With a character's background in mind, the writer can create a quest that is tailored for the character to reveal their humanity absolutely.
# Writing Characters
## Establish Empathy
* For the reader to care about the characters, and by extension the story, the author should *establish empathy for the characters*.
* One way is through *making the characters more likable* , as in sympathetic
* Another way is making them *more relatable*, as in the characters are like us.
* Another way is to *show other characters liking another character*. 
## Establish Rooting Interest
* Show that the character is interesting to us. *Give the characters motivations*.
	* Often it is interesting to point out that what a character wants is not necessarily what a character needs.
	* Establish *what the characters want and why they can't have it*, possibly tying into the plot.
	* Establish how the character's motivation ties into the plot.
	* Characters can feel off if they act against their motivations because the writer wants them to advance the plot.
	* *It is dangerous to give the characters only one motivation*. In reality, people have many motivations. Giving characters only one makes them feel one-note.
* We find characters more likeable if they have a clear motivation in mind. They must want something.
* Motivations let the audience understand why characters do the things they do.
* *Caution*: Do not reduce characters to case studies. There are no definitive explanations for anyone's behavior. *Leave some mystery for motivation*. 
	* Once the deed is done, his reasons why begin to dissolve. 

## Establish the Character's Progress
* Show the *flaws* of the character. The flaws are things that characters can and should overcome about themselves.
* Show *handicaps*. The handicaps are things characters can overcome but the handicap itself was not due to themselves.
* Show *limitations*. These are things the characters cannot overcome. They  are constant for the character.
* *Flaws, handicaps, and limitations* can help establish character motivations. 
* Show the **character arc** they will go through. Often this comes with a question of can the character change and how.
	* Character arcs are stories unto themselves.
	* They must eventually overlap with the overall conflict in the plot or themes of the story.
## Sanderson's Three Scales for Characters
* **Likability** relates to how we empathize with characters.
* **Proactivity** relates to how the characters work towards their goals.
* **Competence** relates to how the characters progress in their arcs.
* These attributes of a character can change over the course of the story.
* That said, **Iconic Heroes** are those that do not progress in any of these categories. They can work for a story, but *these characters tend to not grow or change significantly*.
* This framework allows us to think about the characters and their role in the story and how its told.
* An alternative framing is seen in [[details/narrative/plot/Story by Robert McKee#Principles of Story Design|here]].
# Character Arcs
* Character **Arcs** should change the inner nature of the character. 
* Generally they go as such:
	* Characterization of the character -- what do they seem to be.
	* Character Revelation -- what is the true nature of the character.
	* Conflict -- a contrast between the revelation and the characterization. 
	* Pressure -- the story now involves the character make progressively difficult choices.
	* Change -- the character has changed for better or worse.
# Protagonists
* The **protagonist** drives the story's substance. They are the focused lens through which the audience experiences the story and its metaphorical telling of life. 
* All protagonists [^1]:
	* Are *willful* characters. Their will is powerful enough to sustain desire through conflict.
	* Have *conscious desires*. They know what they want. 
	* May have a self-contradictory, unconscious desire. This makes for interesting [[Character Writing#Establish Rooting Interest|characters]]. 
	* Have the *capacity* to pursue the object of desire convincingly.
	* Are *empathetic*. The audience must relate to them in some way, even if the character in itself is not a likable person.
		* Empathy with the protagonist gives the audience emotional investment even in a despicable character.
		* *Audiences disassociate with hypocrites*. 
	* Takes the audience to the limits of human experience--their final actions leave no question unanswered.

[^1]: Remark: This is an alternate way of framing [[Character Writing|the techniques outlined by Sanderson]].
## Antagonism
* The first steps of the protagonist are usually conservative -- things within their comfort zone they know will get them what they want. However, *a story should show the conservative approach failing--it should show **antagonism***.
	* **Antagonism** is simply a gap between what the protagonist subjectively expected, and the objective reality of the story.
		* This gap marks the difference between character action and character activity. Action is in reaction or creates gaps. Activity is based on what was expected to happen. *Action generates change. Activity does not*
	* The next step of the protagonist towards the object of desire should show risks. These steps show risk-taking.
		* The measure of the value of a character's desire is in direct proportion to the risk he's willing to take to achieve it; greater value, greater risk.

* **The Principle of Antagonism**: A protagonist and his story can only be as intellectually fascinating and emotionally compelling as the forces of antagonism make them.  *In this way, we take characters to the end of the line*. 

* Consider this method for identifying the story values relating to antagonism: Let $P$ be a story value embodied by the protagonist
	* The **Contrary** is a situation that is somewhat the opposite of $P$ but not fully the opposite. 
	* The **Contradictory** is the direct opposite of $P$.
	* The **Negation of the Negation**  - the direct opposite of $P$, but qualitatively worse that the contradictory.
	* *Conflict progress through a pattern that includes the Contrary, Contradictory, and Negation of Negation*.  

# Other Tips
* *Fall in love with all your characters*. If the writer cannot love the character, how will the audience?
* *The root of all fine character is self-knowledge*. The more you empathize, the better characters you write.
