* We can generally treat Groups of Interest like [[Character Writing|characters]] -- with their own motivations and goals. However, the collective comprises of individuals, and there are additional considerations. 
* Some [Notes](https://springhole.net/writing/write-fictional-organizations.htm)
	* Organizations on a large scale operate with a large number of people, more than what can be seen on-screen. This includes things like logistics, recruitment, equipment maintenance, and others. 
	* Consider the details about the organization: 
		* What does the organization do? 
		* How does it operate? 
		* What materiel does it use?  How much?  To where? 
		* How does it acquire its materiel? 
		* What kinds of personnel are employed? Does the organization use volunteers? 
		* What is the organization's facade. For example, for dealing with public or legal matters? 
		* How large is the organization? How many branches are there?  Who governs these branches? 
		* What is the leadership like for the organization? 
		* Where is the organization based? Keep in  mind, large organizations are [[Network Science|harder]] to destroy. 
		* How does the organization maintain operations -- logistics, supply, funding, maintenance? 
* Keep in mind how ranking works.   [[Management]] principles apply here.
	* Knowledge of organization secrets are usually given on a need-to-know basis rather than based on rank. 
* [[The 48 Laws of Power]] apply, especially with regards to internal power struggles. 
* Covert operations should be covert. They should not be flaunting their operations around in public. 
* Organizations rarely try to conscript the unwilling -- this risks desertion. 
* Organizations are likely to have schisms and disagreements internally.
