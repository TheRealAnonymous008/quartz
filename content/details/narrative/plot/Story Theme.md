# Themes
* *Stick to one theme. Too many themes means you end up saying nothing. One theme means your audience has room for interpretation.* 
	* This does not, mean, however, that stories cannot have many themes. It's just that all these themes should be cohesively tied together.
* *The theme is not the message*. A work can explore a theme deeply without having an explicit message and still be profound. The message imparts an idea into the audience.
* [Pose a theme as a question that is answered by the characters in the story or which directly affects the protagonist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNbrMPXqHDI).  The theme is not one word but an idea. 


* Story is an instrument by which you unite ideas and emotions--where you create epiphanies for the audiences at will through **aesthetic emotion**. *Stories combine ideas with emotion to give an immediate meaningful emotional experience*. 
	* In contrast to everyday experiences where meaning is arrived at through introspection
	* The ideas of a story are expressed through sensation, perception, and emotion, appealing to the human aspect unsatiated by reason alone.
	* [[The 48 Laws of Power#32. Play To People's Fantasies|The storyteller is dangerous because through his stories, he conveys an idea charged with emotion]]. Still, an artist is in no obligation to be socially responsible, only to tell the truth of what life really is like.

* The **premise** of a story is the idea that inspires the writer's desire to create a story. The **controlling idea** is the story's ultimate meaning expressed through the action and aesthetic emotion of the last act's climax. *Remember: The premise needn't be kept. Evolve the writing. Discover.*
	* The controlling idea is both the theme, and a constraint set to guide storytelling.
	* If you cannot identify the controlling idea, you cannot captivate the audience.
	* The controlling idea may be expressed in a single sentence, describing how (value) and why (cause) life undergoes change from one condition of existence at the beginning to another at the end.

* There are three kinds of Controlling Ideas:
	* **Idealistic** - expresses optimism, what we wish life to be. The story culminates on a positive idea.
	* **Pessimistic** - expresses cynicism, life as we dread it, but know it so often is. The story culminates on a negative idea.
	* **Ironic** - expresses the dual nature of existence -- simultaneously positive and negative, merging idealism with pessimism.
		* Irony is the truest to reality, and it is also the most difficult to write, requiring dee  wisdom.
		* It requires a climax that makes both a positive and negative statement, said clearly and unambiguously, and said so that the positives and negatives don't cancel each other out.


# A Compelling Idea 
* **Irony** makes the theme compelling. [[Plot Structure|Irony makes for a good hook as it shows]] [[details/narrative/plot/Story by Robert McKee|the duality of life]] [^1]
* A good log line makes [[Plot#Sanderson's Approach|a promise]]. 
* A good log line considers its audience and cost of making (for marketability)
* A good idea says what the story is about in a straightforward manner. Specificity is key.
* It implies a good title that summarizes the scene [^2]
* It is market-tested by pitching the idea to people. Gauge how interested people are from the idea of the story.

[^2]: *Remark:* Disagree on this considering a title is secondary to the experience of creating a story. 
# Conveying Meaning
* We can view storytelling as the *creative demonstration of truth*--the story as a living proof of an idea, the conversion of idea to event. The event structure is the means to express and prove this idea [[Dialogue|without requiring exposition]].
	* A story tells you its meaning. The author does not dictate its meaning. 

* *Your story should surprise you again and again*. Beautiful story design is a combination of the subject found, the imagination at work, and the mind loosely, but wisely executing their craft.

* **Progressions** build by moving dynamically between the positive and negative charges of the values at stake in the story 
	* In this sense, a *story is a dialectical debate between a thesis and antithesis*.
	* The climax of the story ends up as the synthesis -- where one idea dominates the other to give a decisive meaning.
	* *Use the thesis and antithesis to make the other stronger--giving more punch to the story*. Not only that, but they serve to make the story "tell" rather than "preach".
		* *Remember*: If there was no contentious disagreement regarding the theme, it's not substantive or interesting because the audience already knows it--it's boring or comes off as pretentious.
		* Thus, as a storyteller, *entertain the opposite idea to your premise.* The proof of your vision is not how well you assert the theme, but its victory over the enormously powerful forces you array against it.
