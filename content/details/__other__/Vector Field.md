* A **[[Real Analysis|smooth]] vector field** $F$ is defined in a domain $M$ if to each point $x$, there is assigned a vector $F(x)\in T_x M$ [^tangent_space]  attached at that point and depending smoothly on the point $x$. That is, each component is a smooth function. 
  
  We call $F(x)$ the **value** of the field $F$ at the point $x$.
