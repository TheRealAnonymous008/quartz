* Good management is more a matter of choosing appropriate incentives and restrictions than one of removing constraints.

* The **Peter Principle** - When people in a sufficiently large hierarchy are promoted because of their competence, the end result will tend to put everyone into a position for which they are not competent.
* The **Dilbert Principle** - Â the least competent workers are systematically and swiftly moved to the position where they can do the least damage: management. In other words, the persons who least deserve promotion (or most deserve to be fired) will be promoted instead of the competent.

* The **Pareto Principle** - a large fraction of any problem or benefit is caused by a small fraction of the constituents. *Prioritize the important few over the less important many*
# The Basic Human Laws
* [^basic_laws] establishes a set of basic human laws from the perspective of management. 

* **Law of Self-Interest**. *People, not organizations, are self-optimizing.* Individuals make their [[Game Theory|choices]] in accordance with their preferences or goals. Such goals may result in behavior that is counterproductive yet logical for the individual.

* **Law of Individuality** *People are different*. From an operations perspective, this means people behave and perform differently. [^indiv]
	* Pushing responsibility for decision making down to the level of the worker will have varying success, depending on the workers.

* **Law of Advocacy** *For almost any program, there exists a champion who can make it work-at least for awhile.*
	* To be truly effective, champions must be intimately involved with the systems they are trying to change.
	* The sheer speed with which managers are rotated means that the originator of a program is very likely to leave it before it has become thoroughly institutionalized
	* We should look at the ability to survive the loss of the originator as an important measure of the quality of a new system
	* *While champions can be highly influential in promoting change, we should probably strive for an environment in which they are helpful, but not all-important.*

* **Law of Burnout**. *People get burned out*
	* Use revolutionary ideas sparingly. Not every improvement needs to be presented as a new way of life.
	* Do not skimp on training. If a major system change is necessary, make sure all workers are trained at an appropriate level.
	* Use pilot programs to prototype the effect of a revolutionary change.

* **Law of Responsibility** *Responsibility without commensurate authority is demoralizing and counterproductive*
	* Unrealistic targets are demoralizing to people.
	* People should not be punished for things beyond their control.
	* Effective management must be able to distinguish between real performance and noise (variations in this performance due to random chance)
	* Having a clearly defined ultimate authority at all times is essential to making critical decisions on a split-second basis.

[^indiv]: One good example of how this is applied is the **bucket brigade system** where workers carry a task downstream until preempted by a downstream worker. This naturally balances work.
