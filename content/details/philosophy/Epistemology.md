# Schools of Thought
* **Empiricism** - knowledge cannot be acquired through reasoning alone. It requires sensory experience about the world first.

* **Coherentism** - challenges the very notion that there is a foundation of knowledge. Truth is that which is coherent with a set of beliefs, but these beliefs themselves can be arbitrary.

* **Rationalism** - knowledge can be acquired "a priori" -- seen immediately (i.e., through reasoning or derivation) without experiencing it first.

* **Skepticism** - there is no knowledge. Nothing is certainly true.
# Questions
* For all we know, all our experiences may be a dream--disconnected from reality. There remains a challenge -- that we know nothing, and all our beliefs are delusions.
