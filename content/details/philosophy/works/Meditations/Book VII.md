* What is outside my mind means nothing to it. Absorb that lesson and your feet stand firm.

> Among all these \[material objects], thou must stand steadfast, meekly affected, and free from all manner of indignation; with this right ratiocination and apprehension; that as the worth is of those things which a man doth affect, so is in very deed, every man's worth more or less.
> 

* Consider words and utterances in context. Always investigate the true meaning and intent of what people say. When people slight you, understand their rationalizations rather than feel anger.
* Do the best you can, and collaborate with whoever you need to if you lack the experience. *Don't be ashamed to need help*. 

> So many who were remembered already forgotten, and those who remembered them long gone.

> Straight of itself, not made straight. That is how a reasonable creature behaves.

* See yourself as a "limb" rather than a mere "part" of the whole. Doing so frames not only doing the right thing but helping the right people.

> Let it happen, if it wants, to whatever it can happen to. And what’s affected can complain about it if it wants. It doesn’t hurt me unless I interpret its happening as harmful to me. I can choose not to.

* The mind in itself has no needs, except for those it creates itself. Is undisturbed, except for its own disturbances. Knows no obstructions, except those from within.

* Change is a vital process of nature. There is no need to fear it [^7a] [^7b]

[^7a]: Aurelius argues that just as food and material goods require a change to occur, Nature requires humans change their forms til they die.
[^7b]: Aurelius laments "Close to forgetting it all, close to being forgotten."

> To feel affection for people even when they make mistakes is uniquely human. You can do it, if you simply recognize: that they’re human too, that they act out of ignorance, against their will, and that you’ll both be dead before long. And, above all, that they haven’t really hurt you. They haven’t diminished your ability to choose.

* It does the container no harm to be put together, and none to be taken apart. 
* Anger and passion are unnatural. If even the consciousness of acting badly has gone, why go on living? 

> Treat what you don’t have as nonexistent. Look at what you have, the things you value most, and think of how much you’d crave them if you didn’t have them. But be careful. Don’t feel such satisfaction that you start to overvalue them—that it would upset you to lose them.

> Disgraceful: that the mind should control the face, should be able to shape and mold it as it pleases, but not shape and mold itself.

> Whether a man be a spectator of the things of his life but forty years, or whether he see them ten thousand years together, for what shall he see more? [^7c]

[^7c]: The argument being that nothing changes in the future, as in everything exists in harmony still, the logos that governs the Universe still holds. 

> Look not about upon other men's minds and understandings; but look right on forwards whither nature, both that of the Universe, in those things that happen unto thee; and thine in particular, in those things that are done by thee: doth lead, and direct thee.

* Reason ordains that creatures fulfill their purpose as ordained by the logos. Human  are made to work with others.

* *Think of yourself as dead. You have lived your life. Now take what’s left and live it properly.*

> The art of true living in this world is more like a wrestler's than a dancer's practice. For in this they both agree to teach a man whatsoever falls upon him that he may be ready for it, and that nothing may cast him down [^7d]

[^7d]: In short, don't try to dance around or evade your problems. Face them head on. 

* Understand others, the source of their judgments and their actions. It will make you more patient with others.

> When you're bothered by \[things that cause pain], remind yourself "I'm giving in to pain".

* *Take care that you don’t treat inhumanity as it treats human beings.*

> It’s quite possible to be a good man without anyone realizing it.. \[...]  you don’t need much to live happily  \[...] just because you’ve abandoned your hopes of becoming a great thinker or scientist, don’t give up on attaining freedom, achieving humility, serving others, obeying God.

> Then hath a man attained to the estate of perfection in his life and conversation when he so spends every day, as if it were his last day.

> A very ridiculous thing it is, that any man should dispense with vice and wickedness in himself, which is in his power to restrain; and should go about to suppress it in others, which is altogether impossible [^7d] [^7e]

[^7d]: The reasoning is that even the gods have had to put up with human wickedness since Man first came to be, and yet they have not complained. Of course, this presupposes the gods are real to begin with. If Gods = Universe, then this simply highlights the indifference of the Universe. 
[^7e]: It’s silly to try to escape other people’s faults. They are inescapable. Just try to escape your own.

* Things that are neither social nor rational are inferior.

> No one objects to what is useful to him. 
> 
> To be of use to others is natural. 
> 
> Then don’t object to what is useful to you—being of use.
