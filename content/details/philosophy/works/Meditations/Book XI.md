* Tragedy teaches us what can happen, and that it happens inevitability, and that we have to endure them. Comedy teaches us to keep our ego in check. [^11a]

> A branch cut away from the branch beside it is simultaneously cut away from the whole tree. So too a human being separated from another is cut loose from the whole community. \[...]

* Don't let people stop you from living a virtuous life, but also don't hold them in contempt.
> Because anger, too, is weakness, as much as breaking down and giving up the struggle. Both are deserters: the man who breaks and runs, and the one who lets himself be alienated from his fellow humans. 

> It’s the pursuit of these things, and your attempts to avoid them, that leave you in such turmoil. And yet they aren’t seeking you out; you are the one seeking them.
