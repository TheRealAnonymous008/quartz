### 1. Never Outshine The Master
* Always make those above you feel comfortably superior. All Masters want to appear more superior than other people.
* Be not yourself in front of an insecure Master; Never imagine that just because you have the Master's favor you can do anything.

### 2. Never Put Too Much Trust In Friends, Learn How To Use Enemies.
* You have more to fear from friends than from enemies. They will betray you more quickly for they are easily aroused to envy. They also become spoiled and ingenuine. They make us feel complacent.
* Hire a former enemy and he will be more loyal and reliable than a friend, because he has more to prove. Without enemies, we grow lazy.

### 3. Conceal Your Intentions
* Keep people off-balance and in the dark by never revealing the purpose behind your actions. 
* Use Decoyed Objects of Desire and Red Herrings to Throw People Off The Scent.
	* By being open you make yourself predictable and familiar that it is impossible to respect or fear you.
	* If you yearn for power, lay honesty aside. People easily mistake sincerity for honesty; People want to believe others are honest.
* Use Smoke Screens to Disguise Your Actions.
	* The bland exterior is often the perfect smoke screen. It is this unreadability that draws people to you and makes you appear a person of power.
	* Noble gestures are themselves deceptive.
	* We like to think our behavior conforms to patterns. Establish patterns and play to the anticipation of others.

### 4. Always Say Less Than Necessary
* The more you say the more common you appear, and the less in control. 
* The less you say, the more profound and mysterious you appear. Powerful people impress and intimidate by saying less.

### 5. So Much Depends On Reputation -- Guard It with your Life
* Reputation is the cornerstone of power. Through reputation alone, you can intimidate and win. Reputation gives us security.
* Sow doubt to destroy your enemy's reputations.
* Appearances are the barometer to judgment. Maintain a reputation of your own creation to maintain a degree of control.
* There is nothing to be gained by neglecting your reputation. Not caring about what others think of you gives you a reputation of insolence and arrogance. By not caring, you let others decide this for you. Be the master of your own fate and guard your reputation

### 6. Court Attention At All Costs.
* Everything is judged by its appearance; what is unseen counts for nothing
* Do anything to make yourself seem larger than life and shine more brightly than those around you. 
* An air of mystery heightens your presence; it creates anticipation. Use mystery to beguile, seduce, even frighten

### 7. Get Others To Do The Work For You But Always Take The Credit
* Use the wisdom, knowledge, and legwork of other people to further your own cause. Not only will such assistance safe you time and energy, it will give you a godlike aura of efficiency and speed.
* Credit is as, if not more important as the thing itself. Be vigilant and ruthless in keeping your creation quiet.
* Never do yourself what others can do for you. It is far better to conserve your forces, pounce on the work others have done and find a way to make it your own.

### 8. Make Other People Come To You -- Use Bait If Necessary
* When you force the other person to act, you are the one in control. It is always better to make your opponent come to you, abandoning their own plans in the process. 
* The aggressive person is rarely in full control. Turn that aggression against them.
* The essence of power is the ability to keep the initiative. Thus (1) Master your emotions and (2) Play with the emotions of others.
* If on one occasion you make it a point of dignity that others must come to you and you succeed, they will continue to do so even after you stop trying

### 9. Win Through Your Actions, Never Through Argument
* Demonstrate, do not explicate. It is much more powerful to get others to agree with you through your actions without saying a word. 
* Understand that words are never neutral. Each man believes they are right and words rarely convince them.
* If it does not matter in the long run, whether the other person agrees, then it is best not to even bother with a demonstration

### 10. Infection. Avoid The Unhappy and Unlucky.
* The unfortunate sometimes draw misfortune on themselves; they will also draw it on you. Thus, do not pity the unfortunate.
* Judge people on the effects they have on the world, not the reasons they give for their problems
* There is nothing to be gained by associating with those who are miserable. There is only power and good fortune to be obtained by associating with the fortunate

### 11. Learn To Keep People Dependent On You
* To maintain your independence, you must always be needed and wanted. The more you are relied on, the more freedom you have.
* Make people depend on you for their happiness and prosperity, and you have nothing to fear. Never teach them enough so that they can do without you

### 12. Use Selective Honesty and Generosity To Disarm Your Victim
* One sincere and honest move will cover over dozens of dishonest ones
* Learn to give before you take. By playing on people's emotion, calculated acts of kindness can turn people into gullible children

### 13. When Asking For Help, Appeal To People's Self-Interest, Never To Their Mercy or Gratitude
* If you need to turn to an ally for help, Do not bother to remind them of your past assistance and good deeds. He will find a way to ignore you. Gratitude is a terrible burden that people gladly discard.
* Instead, uncover something in the request that will benefit him and emphasize it out of all proportion
* Most people opt for the future and forget the past.

### 14. Pose As a Friend, Work As a Spy
* Knowing about your rival is critical. Use spies to gather valuable information that will keep you a step ahead. Using others as spies, however, is unreliable as you have little control over them.
* Better still: Play the spy yourself. In polite social encounters, learn to probe. Ask indirect questions to get people to reveal their weaknesses and intentions
* The brilliance of the maneuver is that not only will you learn, they will mistake your interest in them for friendship

### 15. Crush Your Enemy Totally
* If the ember is left alight, no matter how dimly it smolders, a fire will eventually break out. More is lost through stopping halfway than through total annihilation. The enemy will recover and will seek revenge.
* Have no mercy. Allow your enemies no option. Crush your enemies as totally as they would crush you. The only peace and security you can hope for from your enemies is their disappearance

### 16. Use Absence To Increase Respect And Honor
* The more you are seen and heard from, the more common you appear. Learn when to leave; Create value through scarcity.
* Absence stimulates the imagination. Love never dies of starvation, but often indigestion

### 17. Keep Others In Suspended Terror -- Cultivate An Air Of Unpredictability
* Nothing is more terrifying than the sudden and unpredictable. Predictability gives a sense of control.
* A person of power instills a kind of fear by deliberately unsettling those around them to keep initiative on their side. 
* Only the terminally subordinate act in a predictable manner.

### 18. Do Not Build Fortresses To Protect Yourself -- Isolation Is Dangerous
* The world is dangerous--everyone has to protect themselves. A fortress seems safest, but isolation exposes you to more dangers than it protects you from.. It cuts you off from valuable information, makes you conspicuous and an easy target. 
* Better to circulate among people, find allies, mingle. You are shielded from your enemies by the crowd.

### 19. Know Who You're Dealing With -- Do Not Offend The Wrong Person
* Study the weaknesses of people before deciding whether or not to deal with them.
	* Never rely on instincts. Gather concrete knowledge.
	* Never Trust Appearances. Never trust the version that people give of themselves. 
* Some Opponents:
	* *The Arrogant and Proud*: There is no sanity in perceived slights against them. 
	* *The Hopelessly Insecure*: Their ego is fragile. Their hurt simmers when offended. 
	* *The Suspicious*: Susceptible to Confirmation Biases and Paranoia. Play to this but carefully.
	* *The Serpents*: Cold and Unaffectionate. Their vengeance is hidden with a front. Crush them totally.
	* *The Plain and Unintelligent*: Hard to deceive, and usually a waste of time to deal with.

### 20. Do Not Commit To Anyone
* It is the fool who always rushes to take sides. Do not commit to any side or cause but yourself. 
* *Be Courted By All*
	* By not committing your affections, they will only try harder to win you over.
	* Stay aloof and you gain the power that comes from their attention and frustrated desire. Give them hope but never satisfaction.
	* Desire is like a virus: If we see that someone is desired by other people, we tend to find this person desirable too
* *Stay Above The Fray*
	* Do not let people drag you into their petty fights and squabbles. Seem interested and supportive, but find a way to remain neutral. Let others do the fighting while you stand back and wait.
	* Better still, be the mediator that gains power as the go-between.
	* If you succumb to their emotional entreaties, you will find your mind and time occupied by their problems

### 21. Play A Sucker To Catch A Sucker -- Seem Dumber than Your Mark
* No one likes feeling stupider than the next person. 
* Make your victims feel smarter or better than you are. Once convinced of this, they will never suspect that you have ulterior motives.
* To reveal the true nature of your intelligence rarely pays of. Downplay it.

### 22. Use The Surrender Tactic -- Transform Weakness Into Power
* When you are weaker, never fight for honor's sake. Choose surrender instead. Surrender gives you time to recover, torment, and irritate your opponent. It gives you time to wait and initiate a counter-attack.
* Do not give your opponent the satisfaction of fighting and defeating you--surrender first. Make surrender a tool of power.
* No one comes to help the weak. The weak are alone and must submit
* Martyrdom is an inexact tactic that is as violent as the aggression it combats. There is something selfish and arrogant about martyrs as if they felt their followers were less important than their own glory.

### 23. Concentrate Your Forces
* Conserve your forces and energies by keeping them concentrated at their strongest point.
* Intensity defeats Extensivity every time. What is bloated beyond its proportions inevitably collapses.
* Only the fool flails about without fixing his target

### 24. Play The Perfect Courtier
* The Perfect Courtier thrives in a world where everything revolves around power
* The court serves power in many ways, but most of all it glorifies the ruler. It has the following rules:
	* *Avoid Ostentation*. Talk less about yourself than other people.
	* *Practice Nonchalance*. Do what is assigned to you; do it to the best of your abilities, and never do more.
	* *Be frugal with flattery*. Flatter indirectly
	* *Arrange to be noticed*. Create a subtly distinctive image.
	* *Alter your style and Language According to the Person you are dealing with.* Think of it as artful acting. Viewing people as equals makes you look condescending.
	* *Never be the bearer of bad news*. The King kills the messenger who brings bad news.
	* *Never affect friendliness and intimacy with your master*. The Master only wants subordinates not friends. Make the distance between you clear.
	* *Never Criticize Those Above you directly*.  When you criticize, the Master sees the critic not the criticism itself.
	* *Be frugal in asking those above you as favors*. Nothing irritates a master more than having to reject someone's request. Better to earn your favors. Importantly, do not ask favors on another person's behalf.
	* *Never joke about appearances or taste*. 
	* *Do not be the court cynic*. If you constantly criticize your equals or subordinates, some of that criticism will rub off on you
	* *Be self-observant*. Train your mind to see yourself as others see you.
	* *Master your emotions*. It may be lying, but being honest and upfront makes other see you as obnoxious and arrogant.
	* *Fit the Spirit of the times*. Your spirit and way of thinking must keep up with the times, even if they offend your sensibilities.
	* *Be a source of pleasure*. Human nature dictates we flee from what is unpleasant and distasteful. Control your unpleasant qualities and obscure them when necessary.

### 25. Re-Create Yourself
* Do not accept the roles that society foists on you. Recreate yourself by forging a new  identity that commands attention and never bores the audience. 
* Be the master of your own image rather than letting others define it for you. 
* All the world's a stage. The world wants to assign you a role in life. Once you accept this role you are doomed.

### 26. Keep Your Hands Clean
* You must seem a paragon of civility and efficiency. Maintain a spotless appearance.
* *Conceal Your Mistakes* -- Have a Scapegoat Around To Take the Blame
	* Everyone makes mistake, but those who are truly clever manage to hide them, and to make sure someone else is blamed
* *Make Use Of The Cat's Paw*
	* If there is something unpleasant or unpopular that needs to be done, it is far too risky for you to do the work yourself. You need a cat's paw--someone who does the dirty, dangerous work for you.
	* When the Cat's Paw's role is finished, find a way to get rid of them

### 27. People On People's Need To Believe to Create a Cult-Like Following
* People have an overwhelming desire to believe in something. Become the focal point of such desire by offering them a cause to follow. 
* The larger the group gathered around you, the easier it is to deceive. In a larger crowd, it becomes harder for an individual to remain skeptical. 
* Some Steps:
	* *Keep It Vague ; Keep It Simple*. Make the subject of your cult new and fresh so few will understand it
	* *Emphasize The Visual and The Sensual Over The Intellectual*. Appeal to all the senses, but do not make anyone really think. Make the most ordinary affairs seem extraordinary
	* *Borrow The Forms Of Organized Religion To Structure The Group* Create rituals; organize your followers into hierarchies; rank them on grades of sanctity; give them religious-sounding titles; ask them for sacrifices; talk and act like a prophet
	* *Disguise Your Source Of Income* Never reveal your wealth comes from your followers' pockets. Make it seem to come from the truth of your methods
	* *Set Up An Us-Versus-Them Dynamic*. Given a straw man to react against your followers will tighten and cohere. They have your cause to believe in and infidels to destroy

### 28. Enter Action With Boldness
* Hesitation puts obstacles in your path; boldness eliminates them.
* Everyone admires the bold; no one honors the timid
* Some Manifestations:
	* *The Bolder the Lie The Better*. Largeness of scale deceives the human eye; it awes us and is so self-evident that we cannot imagine there is any illusion or deception afoot.
	* *Lions Circle The Hesitant Prey*. Once you are seen as the kind of person who quickly goes on the defensive you will be pushed around with no mercy.
	* *Boldness Strikes Fear; Fear Creates Authority*. By intimidating with a bold move, you establish a precedent
	* *Going Halfway With Half A Heart Digs The Deeper Grave*. Enter an action with less than total confidence and you set up obstacles in your own path.
	* *Hesitation Creates Gaps; Boldness Obliterates Them*. The boldness of a move leaves no space for doubt and worry
	* *Audacity Separates You From The Herd*. Voice what the public feels--the expression of shared feelings is always powerful.

### 29. Plan All The Way To The End
* The ending is everything. Gently guide fortune and help determine the future by thinking far ahead
* Never lose your head over a vague open-ended dream--plan to the end
* So much of power is not what you do but what you do not do

### 30. Make Your Accomplishments Seem Effortless.
* When you act, act effortlessly, as if you could do much more. What is understandable is not awe-inspiring
* Teach no one your tricks or they will be used against you.
* Resist the urge to have your vanity gratified.

### 31. Control The Options -- Get Others To Play With The Cards You Deal
* The best deceptions are the ones that seem to give the other person a choice. Your victims feel that they are in control but are actually your puppets. Give people options that come out in your favor, whichever way they choose
* Some options:
	* *Withdrawal*. You give people a sense of how things will fall apart without you and you offer them a choice
	* *Color The Choices*. Present the choices in such a way that the one you prefer always seemed to be the best solution compared to the others. 
	* *Force The Resister*. Push them to choose what you want them to do by appearing to advocate the opposite.
	* *Alter the Playing Field*. Your opponents know their hand is being forced, but it doesn't matter because you have changed the playing field entirely. 
	* *The Shrinking Options*. Force your opponent's hand by gradually reducing their options, with each option progressively getting worse. 
	* *The Weak Man On The Precipice*. Control the weak by controlling their options. Exaggerate to them the dangers of choosing the alternative.
	* *Brothers In Crime*. Implicate in your deceptions the very person who can do the most harm to you if you fail. Their involvement can be subtle--even a hint of their involvement will narrow their options and buy their silence.
	* *The Horns Of A Dilemma*. Have your opponent choose between two options, both of which will hurt them.

### 32. Play To People's Fantasies
* The truth is often avoided because it is ugly and unpleasant. Never appeal to truth and reality unless you are prepared for the anger that comes from disenchantment. 
* Life is so harsh and distressing that people who can manufacture romance or conjure up fantasy are like oases in the desert. Everyone flocks to them.
* Never let the fantasy be familiar, keep your victim dreaming and desiring.

### 33. Discover Each Man's Thumbscrew
* Everyone has a weakness. Once found, a weakness is a thumbscrew you can turn to your advantage.
* Some Techniques:
	* *Pay Attention To Gesture And Unconscious Signals*. A person's weakness is revealed by seemingly unimportant gestures and passing words. What oozes out in the little things outside or conscious control reveals weaknesses.
	* *Find The Helpless Child*. Most weaknesses begin in childhood. Be on the lookout for any behavior that should have been outgrown.
	* *Look for Contrasts.* An overt trait often conceals its opposite. By probing beyond appearances, you will find people's weaknesses in the opposite of the qualities they reveal to you.
	* *Find The Weak Link*. In the search for weaknesses, it is not what but who that matters. In a group acting with the appearance of one will, there is always a weak link in the chain. Find one person who will bend under pressure.
	* *Fill The Void*. The insecure and unhappy are the people least able to disguise their weaknesses. The ability to fill their emotional voids is a great source of power and an indefinitely prolongable one.
	* *Feed On Uncontrollable Emotions*. The uncontrollable emotion can be a paranoid fear. Look for passions and obsessions that cannot be controlled

### 34. Be Royal In Your Fashion -- Act Like A King To Be Treated Like One
* The way you carry yourself will often determine how you are treated. By acting regally and confident in your powers, you make yourself seem destined to wear a crown.
* It is within your power to set your own price. How you carry yourself reflects what you think of yourself. Never pretend to erase the distance from the crowd.
* Be overcome by your self-belief. Even while you know you are practicing a kind of deception on yourself, act like a king. You are likely to be treated as one.
* Ask for less and that is what you will get. Ask for more and you send a signal that you are worth a king's ransom

### 35. Master The Art Of Timing
* Never seem to be in a hurry--hurrying betrays a lack of control over yourself and over time. Always seem patient, as if you know that everything will come to you eventually. 
* Learn to stand back when the time is not yet ripe, and strike fiercely when it has reached fruition.
	* Handle drawn out time defensively. When you force the pace out of fear and impatience, you create a nest of problems that require fixing, and you end up taking much longer
	* Handle short-term time offensively. The trick in forcing time is to upset the timing of others.
	* Handle End Time with speed and force. You can wait as long as necessary for the conclusion to come, but when it comes it must come quickly.
* It is the inner turmoil caused by our emotions tends to make time move faster. 

### 36. Disdain Things You Cannot Have -- Ignoring Them Is The Best Revenge
* If there is something you want but cannot have, show contempt for it. The less interest you show the more superior you seem. 
* You choose to let things bother you. You can just as easily choose not to notice the irritating offender. By acknowledging other people, you open yourself to their influence. By ignoring people you cancel them out.
* Never show that something has affected you. That only shows you have acknowledged a problem. Contempt is a dish best served cold and without affectation
	* If there is something you want but cannot have, you should act as if it never interested you in the first place. 
	* When you are attacked by an inferior, deflect people's attention by making it appear that the attack has not even registered. Treat your blunders lightly. Use such a tactic if you are with a master. 

### 37. Create Compelling Spectacles
* Striking imagery and grand [[Symbolism|symbolic]] gestures create the aura of power--everyone responds to them. The image imposes itself as a given.
* Stage spectacles for those around you, then, full of arresting visuals and radiant symbols that heighten your presence. Dazzled by appearances, no one will notice what you are really doing.
* People do not always words, or rational explanations; they want an immediate appeal to their emotions.

### 38. Think As You Like But Behave Like Others
* If you make a show of going against the times, people will think that you only want attention and that you look down upon them.
* It is far safer to blend in and nurture the common touch. Share your originality with tolerant friends and those who are sure to appreciate your uniqueness.
* There are ideas and values that most people accept and it is pointless to argue. Arguments do not work for most hold ideas without thinking about them. The need to show contrarian thought makes one disliked by the people whose beliefs they challenge
* The power you gain from blending in is that of being left alone to have the thoughts you want to have. If you stick to conventional appearances in public, few will believe you think differently in private.
* When you go into society, leave behind your own ideas and values and put on the mask that is most appropriate for the group in which you find yourself

### 39. Stir Up Waters To Catch Fish
* Anger and emotion are strategically counterproductive. Anger only cuts off options. Stay calm and objective. 
* Play on uncontrollable emotions. If you can make your enemies angry while staying calm yourself, you gain a decided advantage. Find the chink in their vanity through which you can rattle them and you hold the strings
* Nothing in the social realm and in the game of power is personal. 

### 40. Despise The Free Lunch
* What is offered for free is dangerous-- it usually involves either a trick or a hidden obligation. What has worth is worth paying for.
* It is often wise to pay the full price--there is no cutting corners with excellence. Be lavish with your money and keep it circulating; generosity is a sign and a magnet for power.
* In the realm of power, everything must be judged by its cost. Everything has a price
* The prospect of easy, sudden wealth plays havoc with the emotions. Sudden wealth rarely lasts for its built on nothing solid.

### 41. Avoid Stepping Into A Great Man's Shoes
* What happens first always appears better and more original than what comes after. If you succeed a great man, you will have to accomplish double their achievements to outshine them. Do not get lost in their shadow or stuck in a past not of your own making. Establish your own identity by changing course. 
* The privileges of birth are impediments to power. They make us complacent. Be merciless with the past--even your own earlier achievements Only the weak rest on their laurels and dote on past triumphs.

### 42. Strike The Shepherd And The Sheep Will Scatter
* Trouble can often be traced to a certain strong individual. Do not wait for the troubles they cause to multiply. Do not negotiate with them--they are irredeemable. Neutralize their influence by isolating or banishing them.
* Act before it becomes impossible to disentangle one strand of misery from another. Let one person suffer so that the rest can live in peace.

### 43. Work On The Hearts and Minds of Others
* Coercion creates a reaction that will eventually work against you. Seduce others into wanting to move in your direction. Ignore the hearts and minds of others and they will grow to hate you.
* It is infuriating to meet with a person who makes no effort to seduce or persuade you. Avoid talking about yourself. Do not ignore the individuality of the other.
* Remember that you are surrounded by people who have absolutely no reason to help you unless it is in their interest to do so.

### 44. Disarm and Infuriate with the Mirror Effect
* Looking at the mirror sometimes makes us feel that we are seeing ourselves as others see us--an object rather than a subject.
* Some Mirror Effects
	* *Neutralizing Effect*. Do what your enemies do; following their actions as best you can, and they cannot see what you are up to. This has a mocking and infuriating effect.
	* *Narcissus Effect*. Mimic a person psychologically to play with the unsatisfied self-love of a child. Show you understand another person by reflecting their innermost feelings.
	* *Moral Effect*. Teach others a lesson by giving them a taste of their own medicine. Objectify the qualities you want them to feel ashamed of. 
	* *Hallucinatory Effect*. Create a perfect copy of an object, place or person. This copy acts as a kind of dummy, and people take it for the real thing because appearances matter more than substance.

### 45. Preach The Need For Change, But Never Reform Too Much At Once
* Everyone understands the need for change in the abstract, but on the day-to-day level people are creatures of habit. Too much innovation is traumatic and will lead to revolt. 
* Never underestimate the hidden conservatism of those around you. The man who initiates strong reforms often becomes the scapegoat for any kind of dissatisfaction.
* The past is powerful. What has happened before seems greater. The fact that the past is dead and buried gives you the freedom to reinterpret it. 

### 46. Never Appear Too Perfect
* Envy creates silent enemies. Appearing better than others is always dangerous, but most dangerous of all is to appear to have no faults or weaknesses. 
* Only a minority can succeed at the game of life, and naturally this rouses envy due to our inflated sense of self. The envy of the masses can be deflected by appearing as one of them in style and value.
* Dealing with Envy
	* Accept the fact that there will be people better than you in some way. However, expel envy outward and use it to push yourself to surpass them.
	* Understand that as you gain power, those below you will feel envious of you. Do not naively accept the façade they show you. Read between the lines.
	* Expect that when people envy you, they will work against you insidiously.  Forestall envy instead, and prevent it from taking root.
	* Do not try to help or do favors for those who envy you. They will think you are condescending them.
	* Be extra sensitive in environments that are more conducive to envy. In such a case, take none of the envy personally.

### 47. Do Not Go Past The Mark You Aimed For -- In Victory Learn When To Stop
* Do not allow success to go to your head. There is no substitute for strategy and careful planning. Set a goal and when you reach it, stop.
* There is nothing more intoxicating than victory, and nothing more dangerous. Realize that in the moment of triumph, you also have to rely on cunning and strategy all the more. 
* The moment of finality has great dramatic impact. What comes last sticks in the mind as an exclamation point.

### 48. Assume Formlessness
* Never bet on stability or lasting order. Everything changes. Adapt.
* When locked in the past, the powerful look comical--they are overripe fruit waiting to fall from the tree.
* See events through your own eyes and ignore the advice others constantly peddles.
