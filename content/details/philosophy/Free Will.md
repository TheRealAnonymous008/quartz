# Schools of Thought
* **Determinism** - every event is a result of antecedent causes. Thus, since we cannot control the past, we cannot control the present and the future. 
	* **Compatibilism** - there is no inconsistency between acknowledging determinism and our practices of holding people responsible for their actions.
	* **Hard Determinism** - freedom of consciousness is inherently incompatible with determinism.

* **Fatalism** - the belief that all events are predetermined, and therefore inevitable.

* **Libertarianism** - free will requires the agent to be able to take more than one possible course of action under a given set of circumstances
# Questions
* Is the consciousness of freedom an illusion? And if so, how do we reconcile the moral implications that we acted as things ought to be rather than as a result of our choices? 
* Assuming freedom requires awareness of one's options based on reasonable thoughts, how do we account for negligence when "a thought simply did not occur to the negligee".
* What is the point of choice if everything has been predetermined anyway. Especially apparent when it comes to fate or inevitable death
