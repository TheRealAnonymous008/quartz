# Proposition Based
* **Fallacy Fallacy**
	* $X$ is a fallacious argument implying $Y$, therefore Y is false.
	* *Refutation*: The fact that an argument is fallacious has nothing to do with the truth of its conclusion.
* **Masked Man Fallacy**:
	* The speaker believes that $X$ is $Y$
	   The speaker believes that $Z$ is not $Y$
	   Therefore, $X$ is $Z$.
	* *Refutation*: Substitution does not apply when we are talking about belief. The belief itself could be wrong, and it does not rule out the possibility of the negation being true.
* **Affirming the Disjunct**
	* $A$ or $B$ is true
	  $A$ is true
	  Therefore, $B$ is not true
	* *Refutation:* The definition of the disjunct simply states at least one of its statements is true. This is insufficient to prove that $B$ is false.
* **Affirming The Consequent** 
	* $A$ implies $B$
	   $B$ is true
	   Therefore $A$
	* *Refutation*: Just because $A$ is a possible condition for $B$ doesn't mean it is the only such condition. 
* **Denying the Antecedent**
	* $A$ implies $B$
	   $A$ is not true
	   $B$ is not true.
	* *Refutation*: The implication holds only when $A$ is true. Otherwise, if $A$ is false, $B$ may or may not be true. 
* **Illicit Affirmative**
	* $A$ is not $B$
	   $B$ is not $C$
	   Therefore $A$ is $C$.
	* *Refutation*: The argument fails to rule out the possibility that $A$ is mutually exclusive from $C$.
* **Illicit Negative** 
	* $A$ is B
	  $B$ is $C$
	  Therefore $A$ is not $C$
	* *Refutation:* The conclusion does not follow with the premises. After all, it is established that $A\subseteq B$ and $B\subseteq C$. 
# Probability Based
* **Appeal To Probability**
	* $X$ MIGHT Happen Therefore $Y$ WILL Happen
	* *Refutation*: This discounts the non-zero chance that X might not happen. 
* **Base Rate Fallacy**
	* $X$ is very likely given $Y$  ; $Y$ is not likely; therefore $X$ is very likely.
	* *Refutation*: This does not take into account that $Y$ is not likely to happen, so by extension $X$ and $Y$ are not likely to happen together either.
* **Conjunction Fallacy**
	* $P(X\text{ and } Y) > P(X)$
	* *Refutation*: The conjoint necessitates that at least $X$ happen, therefore it cannot be more likely than $X$
