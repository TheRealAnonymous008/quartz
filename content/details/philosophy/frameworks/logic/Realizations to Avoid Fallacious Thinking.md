# On The Truth
* *The truth is not always ambiguous*. It need not exist in the middle ground, and sometimes the truth may be as simple as having two possibilities. 
* The truth is not always precise or clean. 
	* Sometimes experts will argue about it, but that does not make the field of knowledge bogus.
	* *The truth is not always found within numbers*. 
		* That said, qualitative anecdotes also require evidence.
* *Consider and Exhaust all possibilities*. Sometimes, we might simply be dealing with a false dilemma. Other times, we may in fact, just be dealing with a dilemma.
	* Also factor in that what is said to be true may be based on unknown unknowns.
* The truth is not necessarily in line with or is justifiable by :
	* One's own belief systems.
	* The authorities
	* One's moral compass 
	* One's appeal to emotions
	* One's notion of absurdity / normalcy
	* Common sense 
	* Ignorance
	* Silence or Absence of evidence.
* *What is is not necessarily the same as what ought to be*. (see **is-ought-distinction**)
# What to Look out For
### Analogies and Comparisons
* Ensure the objects involved in the analogy actually have a sound reason to be analogous. 
* Ensure there is sufficient information to make that analogy.
* Avoid **Reification**. Abstract concepts are not real or concrete things.
### Definitions
* Definitions should be:
	* Precise and Unambiguous.
	* Objective and not trying to appeal to emotions.
	* Within context. 
	* Not subtly used in a bait and switch. 
	* Non-recursive--that is, a concept should not be explained in terms of itself.
	* Reflective of the whole truth and not simply snippets of the truth.
### Premises
* Avoid the following:
	* **Begging the Question** - the conclusion of the argument supports itself as the premise. 
	* **Circular Reasoning** - begin with the conclusion and end with the premises. 
	* **Fallacy of Many Questions** - a question that presupposes something unproven. Often this involves a loaded question that proves something as true regardless of the answer.
### Construction
* Arguments should be consistent.
* Avoid the following:
	* **Moving the Goalposts** -  refuting the argument because of "a lack of strong evidence" even though the argument has sufficiently proven the claim  Essentially, it entails making a new "stronger claim".
	* **Proof by Assertion** -  repeating a proposition many times
	* **Slippery Slopes** - a small premise is argued to blow up to a large premise
	* **Thought Terminating Cliches** - phrases which ultimately serve to end the argument without proving or disproving the point.
	* **Ignoratio elenchi** - the argument may be correct but it should be relevant to the conclusion (i.e., don't miss the point)
### Context
* Just because it was applicable in the past doesn't mean it is applicable now.
	* Inversely, it may be the case that it is indeed applicable even now.
* Just because it was obvious now, doesn't mean it was obvious back then. Keep in mind the information available to us.
* Never take or use things out of context
### Generalizations
* What is true for the whole is not necessarily true for its parts.
* What is true for the parts is not necessarily true for the whole. 
* Ensure objects grouped together have sufficient reason to be grouped together.
* Do not **Prove too much** -- that is, form a generalized conclusion to argue for something specific.
* Exemption to a generalization require justification for them being an exemption.
	* In the same vein, do not ignore accidents or exceptions to the generalization. 
* When making a generalization, make sure to include all the data. Don't cherry pick.
* *Larger sample sizes are better for generalizations*.  The scope of a generalization is an indicator of its quality. It should not be applicable to only a small percentage of the population.
### Subjectivity and Perception
* What others say is not necessarily in line with the unbiased truth.
* What is true is not necessarily in line with people's intentions
* What one perceives as true is not necessarily in line with what is actually true.
* What is said is not necessarily in line with what is real.
### Chance and Causes
* A low probability does not exclude the possibility of something happening.
* **Retrospective Determinism** - excluding the possibility of coincidence. Just because an event happened with another, doesn't mean that the event caused the other to happen.
* **Correlation does not Imply Causation**
	* Just because things happen in a sequence doesn't mean they are causally related.
	* **Causal Oversimplification** - assuming there is only one cause for everything. 
* *Do not attribute to malice what can be attributed to stupidity*.  
* **The Gambler's Fallacy** - independent events affect the probability of other events. 
	* **Inverse Gambler's Fallacy** - on the basis of an unlikely outcome, the process must have happened many times before.
* **Magical Thinking** - false attribution of cause and effect (i.e., irrationality or cultural beliefs)
* *Do not attribute a cause when in fact none such cause exists*. 
# Red Herrings
* These are arguments that are irrelevant and draws attention away from the original topic.
### Ad Hominem
* Attacking the arguer instead of the argument
* **Circumstantial ad hominem** - the arguer's perceived benefit for advancing the argument implies the conclusion is wrong.
* **Poisoning the well** - bad information about the arguer discredits what they have to say.
* **Appeal to Motive** - call into question the motive of the proposer.
* **Tone Policing** - call into question the emotion behind the message rather than the message itself.
* **Traitorous critic fallacy** - The criticism is due to the critic's own affiliations so any argument they make can be dismissed.
### Appeals
* The following are appeals to reason that are fallacious.
* It must be true because: 
	* The authorities say it is true. 
	* The proposer is accomplished.
	* The critic has sufficient knowledge.
	* Its premise asserts positive or negative consequences.
	* It is natural or unnatural.
	* It is new, modern, old, or traditional
	* The arguer is rich or poor.
	* The majority says it is true.
	* By Association. Two thing share something so they are the same.
	* It is dogmatically true or an unstated truism (ipse dixit)
	* It does not come from an unbiased mind.
	* It was commonly held when something else, also known to be false, was also commonly held.
	* It can be inferred from one's origin rather than the context.
	* It is what ought to be (i.e., what is morally right)
	* What ought to be is true (i.e., it is only natural)
* One can fallaciously convince the audience by: 
	* Emotion (i.e., through fear, flattery, pity, ridicule, spite or wishful thinking)
	* Threats
	* Appealing to the hypocrisy of the opponent (it is false because they do not follow their own claims.)
* Phrases and Tactics to look out for
	* "It is not as bad as ..."
	* "I am entitled to my opinion"
	* "Tu quoque / You too" - the statement is false because the proponent does not act according to it.
	* "Two wrongs make a right"
	* Nitpicking the trivial details of the argument.
	* **Straw man** - misrepresenting the argument by broadening or narrowing the scope. 
	* Asserting a cause to explain some data (see **Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy**).
	* **Vacuous Truths** - truths that are technically true but meaningless at the same time
