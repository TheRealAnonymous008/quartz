* *The integral framework allows us to coordinate these multiple ways of knowing and place them into orchestrated action in the world.* 

* Integral Theory posits that all of human knowledge and experience can be placed somewhere within four quadrants

|            | Interior                        | Exterior                      |
| ---------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Individual | Subjective / Intentional  (I)   | Objective / Behavioral  (IT)  |
| Collective | Intersubjective / Cultural (WE) | Interobjective / Social (ITS) |

* *The four quadrants represent both perspectives and dimensions of reality*
	* **Intentional** - individual [[Psychology|psychological development]].
	* **Behavioral** - describes the [[Science|physical]] correlates of consciousness  
	* **Cultural** - describes collective mutations in consciousness (i.e., [[Humanities|culture and worldview]]) 
	* **Social** - describes the plurality of people as seen from outside (i.e., [[Sociology]])
* One cannot understand one of these realities through the lens of any of the others. At the same time, one cannot understand all of reality through just one quadrant


* Within the interior, there are levels of depth, and within the exterior, levels of complexity. This recognizes that *there are many potential layers of development within any domain of reality*

* Reality is composed of **lines of development** which are the various trails one can take to explore human perspectives. These lines of development demonstrate sequentially increasing levels of complexity and depth
* Reality can be in various **states** which are temporary expressions of a particular aspect of reality.
* Patterns are encapsulated using various **types** which are consistent styles that arise in various domains and occur irrespective of developmental level. *Types are very stable and resilient patterns*
* Each quadrant can be studied through two methodological families -- from either the inside or the outside. These zones comprise the **Integral Methodological Pluralism**.

| Zone               | Interior/Exterior | Individual / Collective | Internal / External |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------- |
| Phenomenology      | Interior          | Individual              | Internal            |
| Structuralism      | Interior          | Individual              | External            |
| Autopoiesis        | Exterior          | Individual              | Internal            |
| Empiricism         | Exterior          | Individual              | External            |
| Hermeneutics       | Interior          | Collective              | Internal            |
| Enthomethodology   | Interior          | Collective              | External            |
| Social Autopoiesis | Exterior          | Collective              | Internal            |
| Systems Theory     | Exterior          | Collective              | External            |
