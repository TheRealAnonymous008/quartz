* *Anaximander*: Conjectured that at an earlier age, humans spent their childhood in a prickly bark so that they looked like fish and lived in water. The bark is shed during puberty.
  
  Thus, fish are the ancestors of the human race
  
  Therefore we should abstain from eat fish.

* *Pythagoras*: The soul did not die with the body but migrated elsewhere possibly to another animal.
