* Victory is decided through preparation
* Understand the conditions of the playing field and the players. Sun Tzu identifies the following conditions which can be abstracted [^1.13][^3.17]
	* The moral conviction of the subordinates in upholding their superiors' beliefs.
	* The ability of the players in terms of strategy and tactics.
	* Environmental factors (i.e., terrain, timing, etc.) that lead to an advantage or a disadvantage.
	* The discipline of the subordinates. Such discipline must be enforced with consistency. 
	* The strength of the subordinates; the experience of the subordinates; their strength relative to the enemy.
* *Be flexible*. Adapt and account for circumstance and the strength of the enemy [^1.17], and plan all the way to the end [^4.15].  *Anticipate* that the enemy is also planning against you.
* Preparation involves also *being mindful* of one's own emotions and preconceptions [^2.5]
* *Know yourself and know the enemy* [^3.18][^4.7].
* *Often situations call for sudden impromptu action*. In such a case, little planning is done to seize an advantage [^7.5]. Consider in such a case that the sudden action will cost more, so perform it when it is decisive for victory. *Hence, be prepared to meet the enemy*. 
* *Have an adversarial mindset* even when planning allegiances. Understand all parties involved before committing [^7.12][^7.13]

>	"The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemyâ€™s not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable".
