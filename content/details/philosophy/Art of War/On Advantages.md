* Learn to put yourself in an advantageous position over others.
* *Learn to hide your advantages* [^1.18]. When strong, appear weak. When disciplined, appear disorderly. When courageous, appear fearful[^5.17]. In doing so, the enemy is kept on the move. Conversely, *scout the enemy for their advantages* [^6.22]. Seek to surprise the enemy and undermine their plans.
* *Demoralize the enemy* "Supreme excellence consists of breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting" [^3.2]. This can come through deception. intimidation or making them feel desperate [^6.3][^6.23]. Learn to psychologically manipulate the enemy
	* Be mindful of desperation. *Give the enemy some false hope*. [^3.36] Do not let the enemy realize that all hope is lost as this comes with the realization they will not have anything to lose.  
	* *Target something of value for the enemy* [^11.18][^11.66]. This may also rouse emotions from the enemy and cause them to make mistakes.
* *Use the sentiments of your subordinates to your advantage*. Use hatred and negative emotions towards the enemy to your advantage[^3.16]. Momentum is a powerful tool [^4.20][^5.15] Conversely, *keep a positive image by being in the "moral right"*.  
	* In desperate times, *Use desperation to your advantage* [^9.23]. Desperation can come subtly in your men prefer to advance and get harmed over having to retreat. [^11.58].
* *Secure yourself*. Seek an advantage yet keep in mind that unless the enemy is crushed, there is little room for complacency [^4.1]. Conversely, undermine the enemy's defenses. *Exploit mistakes* made by the enemy [^11.65].
* *Take the initiative to fight on your own terms* . It is better to be the earliest and the most well-prepared than the one who is being rushed and on the defense [^6.1]. This also means luring an enemy away from positions of advantage [^6.11]
* *Avoid the strong and strike the weakest*. In such a way, effort is more meaningful [^6.30] and not drawn out.  Conversely, secure the weakest points as much as possible, but concentrate on only the weakest points. *Remember you only have limited resources*.
	* *Divide and Conquer*. Break the enemy's orderly structures. This will cause the enemy to panic [^11.15][^11.16] and be much easier to pick off.
	* *Attack while the enemy is distracted*[^12.6-12.10]. When starting a disruption, wait for the enemy to be fully disrupted before striking. Make sure that this disruption method will also not harm you, and prefer to do this disruption from outside. 
* *Do not fall for traps* As much as attacking the weakest point is beneficial, make sure you have a way out [^6.10]. This also includes the converse of preceding advice. Do not assume the enemy a fool. 
* *Look for patterns* [^6.34]. Often, patterns reveal something about the enemy. Conversely, make yourself unpredictable. *Strike at places where the enemy has their guard down* [^7.29].
	* An enemy that seems to not be advancing might be scheming something [^9.18]
	* An enemy that is provocative is trying to get you to make mistakes [^9.19]
	* An enemy that seems too relaxed it is potentially a trap [^9.20],
	* Indirectly scout for the enemy's activity by looking at the effects of this activvity on the environment. 
	* *Conversely, become unpredictable, possibly through deceiving your own and changing your plans suddenly* [^11.35-11.38]
* *Do not lose an advantage by being too greedy*. Be surgical and do not expend wasted effort or rouse the enemy further [^8.3].
* *Consider the natural advantages present in the environment itself*. Conversely, realize how these may be used against you.
