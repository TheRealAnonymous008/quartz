# Schools of Thought
* **Behaviorism** - there is no difference between mental states as long as there is a demonstrable difference in the behavior associated with each state (i.e., what they are made of)
	* **Logical Behaviorism** -Mental events can be characterized in terms of what a person might do in a given situation.

* **Functionalism** - Mental states are identified by what they do (how they are expressed in physical states) rather than what they are made of. 

* **Occasionalism** - Physical events do not strictly cause or bring down mental events. Rather, they provide the occasions upon which God inserts mental events of appropriate kinds into our biographies. 

* **Property Dualism** - Mental and Physical properties are very different, but one organized body has both properties. That is, they are subclasses of a larger kind of "property".
	* **Epiphenomenalism** - physical and biochemical events are the sole cause of mental events. Mental events depend on physical events, and mental events cannot impact physical events.

* **Psychophysical Identity Theory** - mental states and their contents are only neural processes, physical-chemical changes that take place in the brain. The mind is simply defined by the brain's processes.

* **Substance Dualism** - Mental and Physical properties are fundamentally different things. Hence, the Mind that thinks is different from the Body that acts.

# Questions
* We cannot be certain that the Mind that is thinking is the Body that is experiencing. This is the **Mind-Body Problem**.
* If the human body and the human mind are correlated, then what about the following possibilities:
	* **Philosophical Zombie** - a thing indistinguishable from humans but has no consciousness. What, then, distinguishes humans from p-zombies? 
	* **Philosophical Mutant** - a thing indistinguishable from humans, and has conscious experiences, but has wildly different mental experiences.
* If we suppose substance dualism, what does consciousness do? If Minds do nothing, why do they evolve? If mental states don't do anything, how do they enter memory? 
* Are you sure that the Mind you have today is the same as the Mind you had in the past?
