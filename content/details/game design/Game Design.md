* The focus of a game designer is creating play experiences, rules and structures that result in a meaningful experience for players. *Every design decision and technological feature should improve the experience of play.*

* Making a game is also a nice opportunity to learn different creative things since many disciplines come together for the making of a game.

* Games are fundamentally inefficient ways to do things (via the lusory attitude) but they imbue an experience with meaning as the players suspend their disbelief.


* [Video games and other media make use of Archetypes too. The best example is found in the use of element-based systems. in this context, archetypes serve as paradigmatic models for contextualizing the world in a way that minimizes cognitive load. Still, it should be noted that archetypes can make games feel the same. The key around this is to reframe these into new contexts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzSzJqAAyxg). [^1]

[^1]: Similar to [[The Psychopathology of Everyday Things|conceptual models]],  [[Archetypes]]. [[Category Theory]] also applies because the identities of archetypes depend on their relations with others.

* There are two camps when it comes to games. In some sense both are right because at the end of the day, a game is about creating an experience. 
	* **Narratologists** - story precedes gameplay 
	* **Ludologists** - gameplay precedes story.
* There are also differing perspectives about whether or not games are objects or processes.
	* *Games are objects* because they have constituent parts.
	* *Games are processes* because they can only happen with a player. 

* [For interactive games, design the player characters not based on what they can do, but how they will be used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EpgjR-k3fE)
* Design for player experience not realism. 

* [Games in Powerpoint are a thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDUiw2BHE5Y)

* [Sid Meier's Covert Action Rule](https://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3773152) - advises that games should not simply be a package of minigames. Otherwise, each minigame will compete with each other for becoming "the most enjoyable part". Focus on what the game is.
