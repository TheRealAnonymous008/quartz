* The focus of a game designer is creating play experiences, rules and structures that result in a meaningful experience for players. *Every design decision and technological feature should improve the experience of play.*

* Making a game is also a nice opportunity to learn different creative things since many disciplines come together for the making of a game.

* Games are fundamentally inefficient ways to do things (via the lusory attitude) but they imbue an experience with meaning as the players suspend their disbelief.

* [For interactive games, design the player characters not based on what they can do, but how they will be used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EpgjR-k3fE)

* Design for player experience not realism. 

# Prototyping Tips 
* Taken from [[How to Prototype a Game in Under 7 Days by Gabler, Gray, and Kucic|Gabler, Gray, Kucic]]
### Setup: Rapid is a State of Mind  
* Embrace the possibility of failure -- it encourages creative risk taking. 
* Enforce short development cycles More time != More quality. One week is good for quick prototyping 
* Constrain creativity to make you want it even more. 
* Gather a kickass team and an objective advisor -- Mindset is as important as talent. 
* Develop in parallel for maximum splatter. During the middle stretch of a development cycle, Do not collaborate for the following reasons. 
	* Risk mitigation - you have more prototypes
	* Friendly competition 
	* Wider thematic exploration 
	* Sharing understanding into a common knowledge pool.
