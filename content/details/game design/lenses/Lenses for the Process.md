### The Game Begins with an Idea 
* [[Creativity|Inspiration comes from everywhere else]]. Find one key emotional experience to build your game around.
* Fall in love with the problem, not the solution. The first step to the game design problem is to recognize there is a problem.
* Pay attention to your subconscious mind. It is your friend when it comes to creativity [^idea_1]
	* Pay Attention to yourself -- your thoughts, feelings and dreams.
	* Record your ideas all the time. 
	* Manage the subconscious mind's appetites judiciously. It cannot operate when it obsesses over something extensively. 
	* Sleep
	* Don't Push Too Hard. Don't expect immediate answers from the subconscious. 
* **Brainstorming Tips**
	* Write down the solutions that immediately pop into your brain. This frees up mental bandwidth for other ideas. 
	* Sketch. Draw some pictures and express your ideas visually. 
	* Use toys. Play with toys to engage with creativity visually and in a tactile way.
	* Change your perspective (i.e., your environment)
	* Immerse yourself in the problem 
	* Crack jokes to loosen your mind (but make sure to reorient yourself).
	* Spare no expense. Don't let materials get in the way of brainstorming.
	* Keep records of your ideas. That way they can easily be retrieved. Exploit the fact we have good spatial memory. 
	* Don't wait for the "one" idea, write everything down, even the stupid ideas.
	* Challenge and destroy your assumptions. Innovation can come from removing your assumptions. 
	* Mix and match categories .
	* Talk to yourself or with a partner. Bounce ideas off of someone.

[^idea_1]: The book alludes to a power nap technique by Dali who slept with a key in hand and a plate to catch the key. When the key dropped, it would make a sound to awake Dali. 

### The Game Improves through Iteration 
* **The Rule of the Loop** The process of game design and development is necessarily [[details/creativity/design/DOET/Design Thinking|iterative]], or looping. *The more you test and improve your design, the better your game will be*.
	* The goal should be to maximize each loop and to make the loop as fast as possible. [[Software Engineering]] techniques apply.
	* Identify risks -- problems within the current design. Eliminate risk as soon as possible via prototyping.

* **Tips for Productive Prototyping**
	* *Answer a question.* The prototype should be designed specifically for a design question.
	* *Forget Quality.* All that matters is if it can answer a question. 
	* *Don't get too attached.* The prototype is only temporary. 
	* *Prioritize prototypes* that tackle higher priority problems and risks. Also consider dependence -- if one prototype solves all other prototypes, do that first. 
	* *Parallelize prototypes productively.*  Do more than one at once
	* *Prototypes do not have to be digital.* Paper prototypes are low fidelity and enable faster iteration.
	* *Prototypes do not have to be interactive* 
	* *Pick a fast loop game engine*. Use systems that are responsive to changes. 
	* *Build the toy first* before the game. Let the game [[Games as Rules#Emergent Systems|emerge]]from the systems.
	* *Seize opportunities for more loops*. When given more time, use it for more loops.

* The Loop goes as follows.
	* State the problem 
	* Brainstorm some possible solutions 
	* Choose a solution 
	* List the risks of using that solution 
	* Build prototypes to mitigate the risks 
	* Test the prototypes. If they are good enough stop. 
	* State new problems and repeat. Often these problems are more narrow in scope.

* **The Method** (by Mark Cerny)  *You are in preproduction until you have finished two publishable levels of the game*, complete with all necessary features. Otherwise, you are still figuring out the fundamental design of the game. 
	* **The Plan to Cut Rule** - when planning your game, make sure to build it in such a way that if 50% of the budget were removed, the game would still be shippable. 
	* **The 50% Rule** - All core gameplay elements should be fully playable at the halfway mark in your schedule.

# Prototyping Tips 
* Taken from [[How to Prototype a Game in Under 7 Days by Gabler, Gray, and Kucic|Gabler, Gray, Kucic]]
### Setup: Rapid is a State of Mind  
* [[The Cult of Done Manifesto|Embrace the possibility of failure]] -- it encourages creative risk taking. 
* Enforce short development cycles More time != More quality. One week is good for quick prototyping 
* Constrain creativity to make you want it even more. 
* Gather a kickass team and an objective advisor -- Mindset is as important as talent. 
* Develop in parallel for maximum splatter. During the middle stretch of a development cycle, Do not collaborate for the following reasons. 
	* Risk mitigation - you have more prototypes
	* Friendly competition 
	* Wider thematic exploration 
	* Sharing understanding into a common knowledge pool. 
### Design: Creativity and the Myth of Brainstorming
* Formal brainstorming has a $0\%$ success rate. You cannot expect [[Creativity]] to run on a schedule. But ... 
	* It gets you thinking about the problem.
	* It helps you critique a concrete feature of the game. 
* Gather concept art and music to create an emotional target. 
* Simulate in your head - Pre-prototype the prototype. Know the idea before even starting a prototype. 
### Development: Nobody Knows How You Made it, and Nobody Cares 
* Build the toy first. Start with the core mechanic of the game. 
* If you can get away with it, fake it. It will [[Minimal Effort, Maximal Impact|save]] you time and money. 
* Cut your losses and learn when to shoot your baby in the crib. 
* Heavy theming will not salvage bad design. 
* But overall aesthetic matters. Apply a healthy spread of art, sound, and music.  Have a sense of art direction. 
* Nobody cares about your great engineering. By overengineering, you can come up with generic tools that never translate into something playable. 
### General Gameplay: Sensual Lessons in Juicy Fun 
* [[Lenses for Game Design - Lenses#48. Simplicity / Complexity|Complexity is not necessary for fun]]. Prove the mechanic works and then make it pretty. 
* Create a sense of ownership to keep them crawling back for more. The games with the greatest replay value had a sort of creation or customization aspect.
* Experimental does not mean complex. It is possible to be experimental but have intuitive UI. 
* Build towards a [[Lenses for Game Design - Lenses#32. Goals|Goal]]. The best goals are an innate part of the gameplay. 
* Make it [[Lenses for Game Design - Lenses#64. Juiciness|juicy]].
