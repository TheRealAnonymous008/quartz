### The Game is Made for a Player
* Remember that the game is made for an audience, a particular [[Players and Why We Play Games|demographic]]. *To create a great experience, you must know what your audience will and will not like. 
* The aim is to be empathic. Understand the game from the perspective of the player. Immerse yourself in the target demographic. 

* [[Players and Why We Play Games]] is a good reference to consider for this.

### The Experience is in the Player's Mind 
* *The player puts their mind inside the game world, but the game world only exists in the player's mind*.
* The mind is the place where the game experience begins. 
* There are four mental abilities that make gameplay possible .
	* **Modeling** - games are models of the real world that are easy to absorb and manipulate.
	* **Focus** - what we focus on at any given moment is determined through a blend of unconscious desires and conscious will. We enter the [[Flow State Model|flow state]].
		* In particular, we can control [[Writing Story Scenes#Pacing|pacing]] to introduce cycles of tension and release. 
	* **Empathy** - we empathize with the mental models of things. As exercises in problem solving, emphatic projection is a good method for problem solving.  *We become other characters* to solve a problem.
	* **Imagination** - not the creative sort, but the mundane sort that lets us extrapolate from inputs. Leave some things to the player's imagination.

### The Player's Mind is driven by the Player's Motivation
* Motivation is tied to the magic circle and the lusory attitude. [[Models for Human Needs|Models of Human Needs]] are useful to apply here. 
	* *Perhaps the most important level for game design in Maslow's hierarchy is self-esteem.* We want the game to judge 
* Another thing to consider is where Motivation comes from.
	* **Extrinsic Motivation** - not of one's own volition to do it for its own sake 
		* **External** - for payment.
		* **Introprojected** - "Because I said I would"
		* **Identified** - "Because I think it's important"
		* **Integrated** - "Because I'm that kind of person"
	* **Intrinsic Motivation** - because I feel like doing it for its own sake. 

	* The act of adding extrinsic motivation to something that is already intrinsically motivating slides it towards externally motivating, draining the intrinsic motivation. 
	* We can also *distinguish pain avoidance from pleasure seeking* When a game becomes motivated by pain-avoiding, it tends to feel less fun. 

|          | Pain avoiding    | Pleasure Seeking |
| -------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| External | Avoid punishment | For rewards      |
| Internal | Avoid shame      | For fun                 |

* Another motivation is *novelty*. In particular *the novelty that makes us think in a new way*. 
	* Note there is such a thing as being too novel -- being too much ahead of its time without having something familiar to ground it on, and relying solely on novelty and nothing else.
