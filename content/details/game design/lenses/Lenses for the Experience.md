### The Designer Creates an Experience
* The goal is not a game but an [[Games as Play|experience]] felt by the players. The game is not the experience. The game enables the experience. Experience is not really (objective) reality, but at the same time experience is all that is (subjectively) real for us.
* Game designers can only design the experience indirectly and this is why game design is hard. Games have to be [[The Fundamentals of Game Design#Interactivity|interactive]] which necessitates creating meaningful play
* We can use the results obtained from [[Psychology]], Anthropology and [[Design]] to guide the creation of experiences.

### The Experience Takes Place in a Venue
* **Private Venues** - play spaces that have some privacy (i.e., at home). We can divide the home into three areas -- 
	* The "hearth" which is the more noisy, public area, 
	* The "workbench" which is for intense activities performed alone and with focus, and 
	* The "reading nook" for more quiet, relaxing places of solitude.
* **Public Venues** - play spaces out in public. These include
	* The "theatre" for more interactive, dramatic experiences
	* The "arena" for public competitions
	* The "museum" for play spaces that involve exploration and selection from a variety of choice "exhibits"
* **Half-Private / Half-Public** - play spaces that lie on the boundary between private and public. This includes playgrounds, gaming tables, and "anywhere" -- games played anywhere at any time.

### The Experience Rises Out of a Game
* The following definitions are only relevant in the realm of design. Defining various aspects of games allows us to gain insight into what it is we are designing.

* *Fun is [[Games as Play#Play of Pleasure|pleasure]] with surprises*. Games are fun. 
* *Play is manipulation that indulges curiosity*. We play because we are willing to indulge in play, and we do it for its own sake.
* *Games are problem solving activities approached with a playful attitude*. In a sense, all games are fundamentally [[Puzzle|puzzles]] and we get the satisfaction from having solved the puzzle.

### Experiences Can Be Judged by Their Interest Curve 
* Any entertainment experience is a series of moments.  *The quality of an experience can be measured by the extent to which its unfolding sequence of events is able to hold [[General Story Writing Principles#Problem Keeping the Audience Interested|interest]]*. 
	* Techniques in [[Writing Story Scenes]] are applicable here. 
	* Applying the analogy of story scenes -- games are entire stories. Levels are their own mini-arcs.
	* The level of challenge also follows an interest curve. 
	* *What we care more about is relative changes in interest*.

* Consider the following when analyzing interest 
	* **Inherent interest** - some events are more interesting than others. For example, risky, fancy, and unusual events. Dramatic changes and events. 
	* **Poetry of Presentation** - the aesthetics of the experience.  
	* **Projection** - the extent to which you compel a guest to use empathy to put themselves into the experience. The suspension of disbelief is powerful. 
		* [[Games as Play#Narrative Play|Games have the advantage of having the player as the main character]].
