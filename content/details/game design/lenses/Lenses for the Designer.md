### In the Beginning, There is a Designer
* Game Design requires confidence, both in one's design abilities and in one's knowledge for a variety of disciplines.
* *The most important skill for a game designer is to listen* - listen to the team, the audience, the game, the client and the self. *Listen [[Reading#Getting Better at Reading|deeply]] and thoughtfully*. [^1]
* The major gift you can have when it comes to game design is to *love the art of [[Game Design]]*. 

### The Designer Usually Works With a Team 
* *The secret to successful teamwork is love*. Everyone in the team has to love the game being made.  The challenges to teamwork, then are: 
	* *Team members incapable of loving any game*. Usually, these are the team members in charge of management. The solution is to get rid of them. 
	* *Team members in love with a different game than the one they are making*. The key is to work with them to see if there is something about the current game they can fall in love with. 
	* *Team members in love with different visions of the same game*. Everyone may have different ideas about what the game will be like. The trick is to get everyone on the same page about the design as soon as possible. Do so through communication and respect. No decision is final until the team agrees it is final.
	* *If you can't love the game, love the audience*. Think of the game as something intended as a gift for an audience. 
	* *If all else fails, pretend* And when you pretend eventually real love will emerge. Ask yourself what kinds of things someone who really loved the game would say and do, and start doing those things. 

* For some designers, it is terrifying that other members of the team will contribute design ideas that threatens their status as a designer.
	* The key is *include the team as much as possible in the design process*. [[The 48 Laws of Power|Set your ego aside]].  Take every idea and suggestion seriously and you will 
		* Have more ideas 
		* Remove the flawed ideas 
		* Have a multifaceted view of the game 
		* Make everyone feel they own the design. 
	* *Leave some ambiguity in the detailed design* so that the team members who specialize in these aspects can come up with their own solutions.
	* The typical process involves 
		* Initial brainstorming 
		* Independent design 
		* Design discussion - aim for a consensus
		* Design presentation - allow for comments.

* *Team Communication is critical*. We need the following 
	* **Objectivity** - use [[Lenses for Game Design - Lenses#14. The Problem Statement|the problem statement]]. All design decisions must solve the problem statement personal preferences aside. 
		* No one owns the idea (so say, the X idea rather than P's idea) 
		* Phrase alternatives as questions. 
		* Critique must be objective 
	* **Clarity** - if communication is not clear, there will be confusion.
		* Check if people understand what you mean 
		* Illustrate whenever possible. 
		* Don't pretend you understand things when you do not.  Ask unashamedly to clarify. 
		* Be specific and concrete. 
	* **Persistence** - write things down. Things recorded can be checked for later. 
		* Make sure someone is taking notes. 
		* Make sure to inform everyone of anything design related. 
	* **Comfort** - when people are comfortable, they are less distracted and communicate more freely. 
		* The room where communications happen should be physically comfortable. 
	* **Respect** - people who do not feel respected speak little, and if they do, they are not genuine. 
		* Empathy.
		* Be polite and patient at all times. 
		* Find nice things to say.
		* Remember to consider the possibility that you are wrong. 
		* Rush to sincerely apologize than to defend yourself. 
	* **Trust** -  the quality of communication matters less than the quantity of communication. There is constant communication and constant problem solving. 
		* Prefer face-to-face communication over digital communication. 
		* Observe which team members are with each other. 
		* Give the team every opportunity to communicate together, even if it is not related to the project. 
	* **Honesty** - if one is dishonest, others will find it to be honest around them, which inhibits communication. 
		* Make the team feel certain they are getting the truth from you. 
	* **Privacy** - take time to speak privately with each member when you can. This is for the ideas that they cannot discuss publicly. 
		* This jumpstarts a feedback loop of more trust and more honesty. 
	* **Unity** - every design decision must be agreed upon by everyone. 
		* When there are disagreements, seek a meaningful compromise. 
		* Ask those who disagree why they disagree. 
		* Ask "What would it take to bring you in"
		* "Disagree and Commit" - team members sometimes need to be able to go down a path they don't agree for the sake of unity. 
	* **Love** - when you have all other qualities, the love will shine through.
