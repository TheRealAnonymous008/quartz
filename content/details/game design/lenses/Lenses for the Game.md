### The Game Consists of Elements
* **Mechanics** - the [[Games as Rules|rules]] of the game that describe the goals, the constraints, and the outcomes. 
* **Story** - the [[Narrative|sequence]] of events that unfolds in the game
* **Aesthetics** -- how the game appeals to the [[Games as Play#Play of Pleasure|senses]]. 
* **Technology** - any materials and interactions that make the game possible. It allows the game to do certain things and not do others.

* All of the above are equally important and influence each other. All should work towards the same goal -- the player experience.
	* Never forget the player experience. Not knowing the elements makes us ignorant to how we can improve the experience, but not knowing the experience can make the game [[The Psychology of Everyday Actions|horrible]].
* Deficits in one element of the tetrad can inspire creative designs in another.

### The Elements Support a Theme 
* The **theme** is what your game is about. It is the idea that ties your entire game together
* The primary benefit of basing your design around a single theme is that *all of the elements of your game will reinforce one another*, since they will all be working toward a common goal. 
	* The sooner the theme is identified, the better
	* When the theme is identified, reinforce it as much as possible.
* *The best theme is a theme that [[details/creativity/writing/Story by Robert McKee|resonates]] with players*. Those that are archetypal and universal and they elevate the game.
* Themes operate on the subconscious level. It is about focusing the experience to something important to the players.

### Some Elements are Game Mechanics
#### Space
* *Every game takes pace inside the magic circle.  *
* The space can be discrete or continuous, have any number of dimensions, and be bounded or unbounded or locally connected / unconnected. 
* The goal is to decompose the play space into a simpler form amenable for a specific type of analysis. 
* **Nested Spaces** - are more suited for complex game spaces where there are spaces within spaces. 
* Relevant Lenses: [[Lenses for Game Design - Lenses#26. Functional Space|Functional Space]]

#### Time 
* *Games exist in a certain time and has rules that govern the flow of time*
* Time can be discrete (as in turn based) or continuous (as in real time) or a mix in between (for example, like Chess where there is a turn clock but also a timer)
* **Clocks** help limit gameplay via an absolute measure of time.
* **Races** introduce relative measures of time, which encourages players to be faster via time pressure. 
* Games can also allow us to control time.
* Relevant lenses: [[Lenses for Game Design - Lenses#27. Time|Time]]

#### Objects
* *Objects define what nouns are in the game space*.
* *Objects inside the game space generally have one or more attributes*, one being the position in the game space. 
* Attributes can be statically fixed or dynamically changing throughout the game. 
* *Communicate the state of the objects to the player*. 
* *Rule of thumb*: If two objects behave the same, they should look the same. If they behave differently they should look different. 
* Games that force players to be aware of too many states or pieces to play confuse players. 
* States and attributes provide information. However, *not all game information has to be public*.  We can have 
	* Information everyone knows
	* Information only some players know 
	* Information only one player knows. 
	* Information only virtual agents know. 
	* Information only the game knows
	* Information that is randomly generated .

#### Actions 
* *Actions define what players can do* 
* **Basic Actions** - the base actions that a player can take. 
* **Strategic Action** - actions that are only meaningful in the large picture of the game. [^mechanics_1]
* Strategic Actions are usually those that emerge naturally as the game is played, but are otherwise not integrated into the rules themselves. 
* Interesting emergent actions are the hallmark of a good game. *More strategic actions = more emergence*
* We can make more emergent gameplay by doing the following: 
	* *Add more verbs -- more basic actions.*  Strategic actions appear as the interactions of basic actions with each other, objects, and space.  Do keep in mind game bloat. 
	* *Verbs that can act on many objects*.
	* *Goals achieved more than one way*. Give the player options and let them solve the game their way.
	* *Many subjects* - have many objects that can take the game actions.
	* *Add side effects that change constraints* - force multiple aspects of the game to change with every basic action. 
* *Innovative mechanics are those that give new basic or strategic actions*.

### Rules
* *Rules make all the [[Games as Rules|mechanics]] possible, alongside defining the game's goals*.
* [[Models for Game Rules]] apply here. 
* When your game changes modes in a dramatic way, it is important to let players know which mode they are in.
* Too many modes and the player gets confused. 
* Players should never spend so much time in a subgame that they forget what they were doing in the main game. 
* *Video games have the advantage that the computer can enforce the rules*. But, make sure the player has a good model. [[Knowledge in the Head and In the World]] applies here. 
* If players feel like the game can be cheated, some will [[Games as Rules#Subverting Rules|cheat]] while others will not play.
* *The Most important rule of the game is its goal*. The more easily the players understand the goal of the game, the more likely they are going to want to play. 
* Good game goals are: 
	* **Concrete** - players understand and can state clearly what they are supposed to achieve. 
	* **Achievable** - players think they have a chance to achieve the goal. 
	* **Rewarding** - Give the player something valuable upon reaching the goal. 
* Relevant Lenses:  [[Lenses for Game Design - Lenses#32. Goals|Goals]], [[Lenses for Game Design - Lenses#33. Rules|Rules]]

#### Skill
* *Every game requires the player to exercise certain skills. *
* **Physical Skills** - involving strength, dexterity, coordination and endurance. 
* **Mental Skills** - involve memory, observation and puzzle solving. 
* **Social Skills** - reading an opponent, fooling an opponent and coordinating teammates. 
* Note that *a player's virtual skills in game may improve while their real skills out of the game do not*
	* Virtual skills are a good way to give the player a feeling of power. 
	* The key is a mix of virtual and real skills, and to recognize there is a difference between the two. 
* Consider listing down the skills the players need to have. 
* Relevant Lenses:  [[Lenses for Game Design - Lenses#34. Skill|Skill]]

#### Chance 
* *Chance means [[Games as Rules#Systems of Uncertainty|uncertainty]] which means surprises.* This, of course, requires an understanding of [[Probability]]. 
* Expected values are excellent tools for game balancing but be careful and make sure the statistical models are correct and based on the actual values of actions in game. 
* Remember that [[Logical Fallacy Biases|We do not have a good grasp of probability]]. *Perceived probability is just as important as actual probabilities*. 
* Skill and Chance interact with each other. 
	* Estimating chance is a skill. 
	* Skills have a probability of success (i.e. a risk). 
	* Estimating an opponent's skill is a skill. This also includes bluffing. 
	* Predicting pure chance is an imagined skill. 
	* Controlling pure chance is an imagined skill.
