### The Game Consists of Elements
* **Mechanics** - the [[Games as Rules|rules]] of the game that describe the goals, the constraints, and the outcomes. 
* **Story** - the [[Narrative|sequence]] of events that unfolds in the game
* **Aesthetics** -- how the game appeals to the [[Games as Play#Play of Pleasure|senses]]. 
* **Technology** - any materials and interactions that make the game possible. It allows the game to do certain things and not do others.

* All of the above are equally important and influence each other. All should work towards the same goal -- the player experience.
	* Never forget the player experience. Not knowing the elements makes us ignorant to how we can improve the experience, but not knowing the experience can make the game [[The Psychology of Everyday Actions|horrible]].
* Deficits in one element of the tetrad can inspire creative designs in another.

### The Elements Support a Theme 
* The **theme** is what your game is about. It is the idea that ties your entire game together
* The primary benefit of basing your design around a single theme is that *all of the elements of your game will reinforce one another*, since they will all be working toward a common goal. 
	* The sooner the theme is identified, the better
	* When the theme is identified, reinforce it as much as possible.
* *The best theme is a theme that [[details/narrative/plot/Story by Robert McKee|resonates]] with players*. Those that are archetypal and universal and they elevate the game.
* Themes operate on the subconscious level. It is about focusing the experience to something important to the players.

### Some Elements are Game Mechanics
#### Space
* *Every game takes pace inside the magic circle.  *
* The space can be discrete or continuous, have any number of dimensions, and be bounded or unbounded or locally connected / unconnected. 
* The goal is to decompose the play space into a simpler form amenable for a specific type of analysis. 
* **Nested Spaces** - are more suited for complex game spaces where there are spaces within spaces. 
* Relevant Lenses: [[Lenses for Game Design - Lenses#26. Functional Space|Functional Space]]

#### Time 
* *Games exist in a certain time and has rules that govern the flow of time*
* Time can be discrete (as in turn based) or continuous (as in real time) or a mix in between (for example, like Chess where there is a turn clock but also a timer)
* **Clocks** help limit gameplay via an absolute measure of time.
* **Races** introduce relative measures of time, which encourages players to be faster via time pressure. 
* Games can also allow us to control time.
* Relevant lenses: [[Lenses for Game Design - Lenses#27. Time|Time]]

#### Objects
* *Objects define what nouns are in the game space*.
* *Objects inside the game space generally have one or more attributes*, one being the position in the game space. 
* Attributes can be statically fixed or dynamically changing throughout the game. 
* *Communicate the state of the objects to the player*. 
* *Rule of thumb*: If two objects behave the same, they should look the same. If they behave differently they should look different. 
* Games that force players to be aware of too many states or pieces to play confuse players. 
* States and attributes provide information. However, *not all game information has to be public*.  We can have 
	* Information everyone knows
	* Information only some players know 
	* Information only one player knows. 
	* Information only virtual agents know. 
	* Information only the game knows
	* Information that is randomly generated .

#### Actions 
* *Actions define what players can do* 
* **Basic Actions** - the base actions that a player can take. 
* **Strategic Action** - actions that are only meaningful in the large picture of the game. [^mechanics_1]
* Strategic Actions are usually those that emerge naturally as the game is played, but are otherwise not integrated into the rules themselves. 
* Interesting emergent actions are the hallmark of a good game. *More strategic actions = more emergence*
* We can make more emergent gameplay by doing the following: 
	* *Add more verbs -- more basic actions.*  Strategic actions appear as the interactions of basic actions with each other, objects, and space.  Do keep in mind game bloat. 
	* *Verbs that can act on many objects*.
	* *Goals achieved more than one way*. Give the player options and let them solve the game their way.
	* *Many subjects* - have many objects that can take the game actions.
	* *Add side effects that change constraints* - force multiple aspects of the game to change with every basic action. 
* *Innovative mechanics are those that give new basic or strategic actions*.

#### Rules
* *Rules make all the [[Games as Rules|mechanics]] possible, alongside defining the game's goals*.
* [[Models for Game Rules]] apply here. 
* When your game changes modes in a dramatic way, it is important to let players know which mode they are in.
* Too many modes and the player gets confused. 
* Players should never spend so much time in a subgame that they forget what they were doing in the main game. 
* *Video games have the advantage that the computer can enforce the rules*. But, make sure the player has a good model. [[Knowledge in the Head and In the World]] applies here. 
* If players feel like the game can be cheated, some will [[Games as Rules#Subverting Rules|cheat]] while others will not play.
* *The Most important rule of the game is its goal*. The more easily the players understand the goal of the game, the more likely they are going to want to play. 
* Good game goals are: 
	* **Concrete** - players understand and can state clearly what they are supposed to achieve. 
	* **Achievable** - players think they have a chance to achieve the goal. 
	* **Rewarding** - Give the player something valuable upon reaching the goal. 
* Relevant Lenses:  [[Lenses for Game Design - Lenses#32. Goals|Goals]], [[Lenses for Game Design - Lenses#33. Rules|Rules]]

#### Skill
* *Every game requires the player to exercise certain skills. *
* **Physical Skills** - involving strength, dexterity, coordination and endurance. 
* **Mental Skills** - involve memory, observation and puzzle solving. 
* **Social Skills** - reading an opponent, fooling an opponent and coordinating teammates. 
* Note that *a player's virtual skills in game may improve while their real skills out of the game do not*
	* Virtual skills are a good way to give the player a feeling of power. 
	* The key is a mix of virtual and real skills, and to recognize there is a difference between the two. 
* Consider listing down the skills the players need to have. 
* Relevant Lenses:  [[Lenses for Game Design - Lenses#34. Skill|Skill]]

#### Chance 
* *Chance means [[Games as Rules#Systems of Uncertainty|uncertainty]] which means surprises.* This, of course, requires an understanding of [[Probability]]. 
* Expected values are excellent tools for game balancing but be careful and make sure the statistical models are correct and based on the actual values of actions in game. 
* Remember that [[Logical Fallacy Biases|We do not have a good grasp of probability]]. *Perceived probability is just as important as actual probabilities*. 
* Skill and Chance interact with each other. 
	* Estimating chance is a skill. 
	* Skills have a probability of success (i.e. a risk). 
	* Estimating an opponent's skill is a skill. This also includes bluffing. 
	* Predicting pure chance is an imagined skill. 
	* Controlling pure chance is an imagined skill.

### Game Mechanics Must Be in Balance 
* Balancing a game is nothing more than adjusting the elements of the game until they deliver the experience you want.
* Tips are further elaborated [[Game Balancing|here]].

### Game Mechanics Support Puzzles 
* More on [[Puzzle|puzzles]] here.  The principles for making [[Puzzle Design|good puzzles]] also apply. 
* Implicit puzzles satisfy the lens of [[Lenses for Game Design - Lenses#49. Elegance|elegance]] because they stimulate the head and serve additional purposes in game.

### Players Play games through an interface
* The **interface** is anything between the player and the game world.
![[Games and Interfaces.png]]
<figcaption> Physical Interfaces and Virtual Interfaces from Schell. </figcaption>

* The less abstraction to our interface, the more we feel an emotional connection to the content. 
* The goal of the interface is for the player to feel in control of the experience. 
	* If the interface becomes second nature to the player, the player will project themselves into the game itself while ignoring the interface.
	* Touch controls tend to feel the most intuitive. 
* *The quality of the [[Knowing What To Do -- Constraints, Discoverability and Feedback|feedback]] provided by the interface determines how much the player understands the game*
	* **Tenth of a Second Rule**  If there is no immediate feedback (within a tenth of a second), the player will assume there is something wrong with the interface.
* Favor juicy systems - just a little interaction gives a continuous flow of reward.

* An important goal of the interface is to *communicate information*. Consider the following in establishing channels of information 
	* List and prioritize information 
	* List the channels of information (i.e., how they are communicated)
	* Map information to channels 
	* Review the dimensions (i.e., attributes) of each channel.
		* *Some dimensions can reinforce the information*
		* Other dimensions can give additional information. However, you have to tell the player what these extra dimensions mean. 

* Consider **modes** - which are changes in the mapping of controls under certain contexts. *Consider the following to make the game less confusing*. 
	* Use as few modes as possible. 
	* Avoid overlapping modes. If modes have to overlap, make sure they use different channels. 
	* Make different modes look as different as possible. Consider the feedback and transparency of each mode. 
		* Change something large and visible on screen.
		* Change the action the avatar is taking. 
		* Change the on-screen data. 
		* Change the camera perspective. 

* Other tips for interfaces. 
	* **Top Down Approach** Steal from another well known interface. 
	* **Bottom Up Approach** Design the interface from scratch by listing out information, channels, and dimensions.
	* Design around physical interfaces. That is, design with a physical interface (i.e., keyboard, controller) in mind.
	* Theme the interface. [[Lenses for Game Design - Lenses#11. Unification|Unification]] applies. 
	* Remember that sound maps to touch. 
	* Balance [[Trade Offs#Freedom of Choice Trade-Off|options and simplicity]] with layers of interfaces of increasing detail.
	* Use metaphors - make the interface resemble something the player has seen before.
	* If it looks different, it should act different. 
	* Repeatedly Test and refine. The [[details/creativity/design/DOET/Design Thinking|iterative process]] applies. 
	* Break the rules to help the player.

### Some Interfaces Create a Feeling of Presence
* The magic of VR and AR interfaces comes, not in fooling the mind, but fooling the mind's sense of the body -- *fooling proprioception*.  It is the feeling that you are present within the simulation itself. 

|            | Here    | There        |
| ---------- | ------- | ------------ |
| Real World | Reality | Telepresence |
| Simulation | AR      | VR             |

* *Game designers create new realities*. 
	* **Logical Reality** - the [[Games as Rules|rules]] of cause and effect. 
	* **Spatial Reality** - how I move through space.
	* **Proprioceptive Reality** - where it feels like my body is
	* **Social Reality** - how I interact with others. 

* *The heart of AR and VR is presence*. Here are six ways to break presence. 
	* *Motion sickness*. Some tips to prevent this are as follows:
		* *Keep the framerate up.* 60 fps at minimum. 
		* *Avoid virtual camera movement.* Spatial motion risks creating motion sickness.
		* If the camera must move, *don't accelerate* it. 
		* *Hide the edges of the visual field* (i.e., the vignette). The brain uses peripheral vision to determine motion. 
		* *Teleport sparingly*. The mind creates a 3D model but only when it has looked at the space.
		* *Keep the horizon level*. Avoid any form of virtual rotation (i.e., having the game rotate). Let the players do the rotation. 
	* *Counterintuitive interactions.* Interactions must match with what the players expect as reality. 
	* *Intensity overload*. This is when the experience becomes "too real" that the players want to stop. The player's mind is fighting against the presence. 
	* *Unrealistic audio*. Hearing is believing. You use your sound to decide where your body is. 
	* *Proprioceptive Disconnect*. When the virtual avatar has a disconnect with the physical avatar. When the player can see their virtual avatar, it feels uncanny. 
	* *Lack of identity*. If the NPCs do not address your presence in the world, the player will realize they aren't really there.

* Here are six presence builders
	* *Hand presence*. Something about seeing your hand convinces you the world is solid and real. When using tools in the virtual environment, most players can't remember. 
	* *Social presence*. Being able to speak and gesture with VR and AR creates a special experience. You feel that you are part of a social space. 
	* *Familiarity*. Have set pieces that the player can recognize. 
	* *Realistic Audio*. This includes spatialized sound and proper acoustics. 
	* *Proprioceptive alignment*. The real life body and the virtual body are strongly aligned. 
	* *Comedy*. It is easier to build a presence in a comedic world than in a serious world. Discovering the crazy rules of the world is the delight. 

* *Encourage Looking around*. Give the player reasons to look around by making some items invisible to the player's immediate FOV. 
* *Consider brownboxing*. Build an experience in reality to simulate a VR scene in the real world. This is the VR counter part to testing on pen and paper. 
* *Inputs are important in VR / AR*. Design your game around these input mechanisms.

### The Team Builds a Game with Technology
* Technology, among the other elements of the tetrad, is the most dynamic, volatile and unpredictable.  The **technology** of the game pertains to its medium. 
	* **Foundational Technology** - the ones that make a new kind of experience possible. 
	* **Decorational Technology** - makes an existing experience better.
* Because of the pressure for novelty, *it can be easy to get swept away in the possibilities of what technology can do* and forget that our purpose is to create a great game.
* When encountering a new technology, *ask your self how you can make it foundational to your game*. 

* It is best to understand the [[Hype Cycle]] because:
	* **Immunity** - you can avoid risking your career on a technology you haven't seen work. 
	* **Inoculation** - if you can make others understand the Hype Cycle, you may be able to save your team from making a dangerous decision 
	* **Fund raising** - get the money before the trough of disillusionment then make something great despite the technology. 

* Be aware of the **Innovator's Dilemma** - *Technology companies fail because they make the mistake of listening to their customers*. 
	* This situation is when new technology has appeared that is different and not yet good enough to replace the old one. 
	* The oversight comes from sticking to the old technology because the new technology is not good enough. But, this doesn't take into account innovations in the new technology.
* **The Law of Divergence** - as more technology emerges, we expect them to diverge, manifesting in different devices that let you mix and match. 
	* *Exception*: Pocket-held technologies that are convergent for convenience. 

* *Don't just understand what is new, understand what is coming next*. The predictions aren't important, rather they let you develop instincts for how technology fits with the human experience. 

* According to [[The Art of Game Design -- A Book of Lenses by Schell|Schell]], there are five types of technology that will lead to a better world. 
	* **Magical Interface** - players want interfaces that feel magical. 
	* **Fair Payment** - payment systems that players find fair while sustaining the ability to create great games. 
	* **Less A more I** - improvements to [[Artificial Intelligence]] technology to make them more natural. 
	* **Family and Friends** - games that are meant to be played with the family. 
	* **Transformation** - games that help people change into people they truly want to be.
