### The Game Consists of Elements
* **Mechanics** - the [[Games as Rules|rules]] of the game that describe the goals, the constraints, and the outcomes. 
* **Story** - the [[Narrative|sequence]] of events that unfolds in the game
* **Aesthetics** -- how the game appeals to the [[Games as Play#Play of Pleasure|senses]]. 
* **Technology** - any materials and interactions that make the game possible. It allows the game to do certain things and not do others.

* All of the above are equally important and influence each other. All should work towards the same goal -- the player experience.
	* Never forget the player experience. Not knowing the elements makes us ignorant to how we can improve the experience, but not knowing the experience can make the game [[The Psychology of Everyday Actions|horrible]].
* Deficits in one element of the tetrad can inspire creative designs in another.

### The Elements Support a Theme 
* The **theme** is what your game is about. It is the idea that ties your entire game together
* The primary benefit of basing your design around a single theme is that *all of the elements of your game will reinforce one another*, since they will all be working toward a common goal. 
	* The sooner the theme is identified, the better
	* When the theme is identified, reinforce it as much as possible.
* *The best theme is a theme that [[details/creativity/writing/Story by Robert McKee|resonates]] with players*. Those that are archetypal and universal and they elevate the game.
* Themes operate on the subconscious level. It is about focusing the experience to something important to the players.

### Some Elements are Game Mechanics
#### Space
* *Every game takes pace inside the magic circle.  *
* The space can be discrete or continuous, have any number of dimensions, and be bounded or unbounded or locally connected / unconnected. 
* The goal is to decompose the play space into a simpler form amenable for a specific type of analysis. 
* **Nested Spaces** - are more suited for complex game spaces where there are spaces within spaces. 
* Relevant Lenses: [[Lenses for Game Design - Lenses#26. Functional Space|Functional Space]]

#### Time 
* *Games exist in a certain time and has rules that govern the flow of time*
* Time can be discrete (as in turn based) or continuous (as in real time) or a mix in between (for example, like Chess where there is a turn clock but also a timer)
* **Clocks** help limit gameplay via an absolute measure of time.
* **Races** introduce relative measures of time, which encourages players to be faster via time pressure. 
* Games can also allow us to control time.
* Relevant lenses: [[Lenses for Game Design - Lenses#27. Time|Time]]

#### Objects
* *Objects define what nouns are in the game space*.
* *Objects inside the game space generally have one or more attributes*, one being the position in the game space. 
* Attributes can be statically fixed or dynamically changing throughout the game. 
* *Communicate the state of the objects to the player*. 
* *Rule of thumb*: If two objects behave the same, they should look the same. If they behave differently they should look different. 
* Games that force players to be aware of too many states or pieces to play confuse players. 
* States and attributes provide information. However, *not all game information has to be public*.  We can have 
	* Information everyone knows
	* Information only some players know 
	* Information only one player knows. 
	* Information only virtual agents know. 
	* Information only the game knows
	* Information that is randomly generated .
* Relevant Lenses: [[Lenses for Game Design - Lenses#28. State Machine|State Machine]], [[Lenses for Game Design - Lenses#29. Secrets|Secrets]]

#### Actions 
* *Actions define what players can do* 
* **Basic Actions** - the base actions that a player can take. 
* **Strategic Action** - actions that are only meaningful in the large picture of the game. [^mechanics_1]
* Strategic Actions are usually those that emerge naturally as the game is played, but are otherwise not integrated into the rules themselves. 
* Interesting emergent actions are the hallmark of a good game. *More strategic actions = more emergence*
* We can make more emergent gameplay by doing the following: 
	* *Add more verbs -- more basic actions.*  Strategic actions appear as the interactions of basic actions with each other, objects, and space.  Do keep in mind game bloat. 
	* *Verbs that can act on many objects*.
	* *Goals achieved more than one way*. Give the player options and let them solve the game their way.
	* *Many subjects* - have many objects that can take the game actions.
	* *Add side effects that change constraints* - force multiple aspects of the game to change with every basic action. 
* *Innovative mechanics are those that give new basic or strategic actions*. 
* Relevant Lenses: [[Lenses for Game Design - Lenses#30. Emergence|Emergence]], [[Lenses for Game Design - Lenses#31. Action|Action]]

#### Rules
* *Rules make all the [[Games as Rules|mechanics]] possible, alongside defining the game's goals*.
* [[Models for Game Rules]] apply here. 
* When your game changes modes in a dramatic way, it is important to let players know which mode they are in.
* Too many modes and the player gets confused. 
* Players should never spend so much time in a subgame that they forget what they were doing in the main game. 
* *Video games have the advantage that the computer can enforce the rules*. But, make sure the player has a good model. [[Knowledge in the Head and In the World]] applies here. 
* If players feel like the game can be cheated, some will [[Games as Rules#Subverting Rules|cheat]] while others will not play.
* *The Most important rule of the game is its goal*. The more easily the players understand the goal of the game, the more likely they are going to want to play. 
* Good game goals are: 
	* **Concrete** - players understand and can state clearly what they are supposed to achieve. 
	* **Achievable** - players think they have a chance to achieve the goal. 
	* **Rewarding** - Give the player something valuable upon reaching the goal. 
* Relevant Lenses:  [[Lenses for Game Design - Lenses#32. Goals|Goals]], [[Lenses for Game Design - Lenses#33. Rules|Rules]]

#### Skill
* *Every game requires the player to exercise certain skills. *
* **Physical Skills** - involving strength, dexterity, coordination and endurance. 
* **Mental Skills** - involve memory, observation and puzzle solving. 
* **Social Skills** - reading an opponent, fooling an opponent and coordinating teammates. 
* Note that *a player's virtual skills in game may improve while their real skills out of the game do not*
	* Virtual skills are a good way to give the player a feeling of power. 
	* The key is a mix of virtual and real skills, and to recognize there is a difference between the two. 
* Consider listing down the skills the players need to have. 
* Relevant Lenses:  [[Lenses for Game Design - Lenses#34. Skill|Skill]]

#### Chance 
* *Chance means [[Games as Rules#Systems of Uncertainty|uncertainty]] which means surprises.* This, of course, requires an understanding of [[Probability]]. 
* Expected values are excellent tools for game balancing but be careful and make sure the statistical models are correct and based on the actual values of actions in game. 
* Remember that [[Logical Fallacy Biases|We do not have a good grasp of probability]]. *Perceived probability is just as important as actual probabilities*. 
* Skill and Chance interact with each other. 
	* Estimating chance is a skill. 
	* Skills have a probability of success (i.e. a risk). 
	* Estimating an opponent's skill is a skill. This also includes bluffing. 
	* Predicting pure chance is an imagined skill. 
	* Controlling pure chance is an imagined skill.

### Game Mechanics Must Be in Balance 
* Balancing a game is nothing more than adjusting the elements of the game until they deliver the experience you want.

#### Fairness 
* Players want to feel that the forces working against them do not have an advantage that will make them impossible to defeat 
* **Symmetric Games** - players have equal powers and resources. Suitable for Competitive games.  
	* Balancing necessitates considering first-move advantage (either random or least skilled first)
* **Asymmetrical Games** - players have different resources and abilities. We may want this for a variety of reasons 
	* To simulate a real world experience 
	* To allow for exploration 
	* To allow personalization by giving players resources that match their skills.
	* To level the playing field. 
	* To create interesting situations
* One way to balance an Asymmetrical game is to give players the same total "sum value" of resources, with each resources having the same values.
* Another way is *circular balance* where there is a rock-paper-scissors dynamic. Something exists as a counter to something else.
* Relevant Lenses: [[Lenses for Game Design - Lenses#37. Fairness|Fairness]],

#### Challenge vs Success
* The appropriate level of challenge keeps the [[Lenses for the Player#The Experience is in the Player's Mind|player]] in [[Flow State Model|flow]]. 
* Some common techniques for balancing:
	* Increase difficulty with each success. However, consider the tense and release pattern
	* Let players get through easy parts fast. 
	* Create layers of challenge (for example via a scoring system)
	* Let players choose the difficulty level (this comes at the cost of balancing more versions of the game)
	* Playtesting with a variety of players. 
	* Give the losers a break 
* It may make sense to consider what percentage of players do you want to complete the game. 
* *Remember*: Just learning the game is already a challenge
* Relevant Lenses:  [[Lenses for Game Design - Lenses#38. Challenge|Challenge]],

#### Meaningful Choice
* Games should have [[The Fundamentals of Game Design#Player Choice|meaningful]] choices. 
* [[Games as Rules#Game Theory Systems|Dominant strategies]] ruin game balance and make the game less fun. Balancing should get rid of dominant strategies
* The number of choices provided to the player should equal the number of things the player wants to do -- too much and its overwhelming, too little and the player is frustrated.
* Consider **triangularity** - the classic trade-off of low risk low reward and high risk high reward.
* Relevant Lenses  [[Lenses for Game Design - Lenses#39. Meaningful Choices|Meaningful Choices]], [[Lenses for Game Design - Lenses#40. Triangularity|Triangularity]]

#### Skill vs Chance
* Chance and Player skill negate each other. 
* One common way to balance these is to alternate the use of chance and skill in the moment to moment gameplay. 
* According to David Perry, the key to addictive games is designing the game such that players are doing three things
	* Exercising a skill 
	* Taking a risk 
	* Working a strategy 
* Relevant Lenses: [[Lenses for Game Design - Lenses#41. Skill vs Chance|Skill vs Chance]]

#### Heads vs Hands
* Consider how much of the game should involve doing a challenging physical activity vs how much it should involve thinking, again taking into account the preferences of the target demographic. 
* Relevant Lenses: [[Lenses for Game Design - Lenses#42. Heads and Hands|Heads and Hands]]

#### Competition vs Cooperation
* Games provide avenues for both [[Games as Rules#Systems of Conflict|competition and cooperation]]. These can be combined and used in different ways. 
* Relevant Lenses: [[Lenses for Game Design - Lenses#43. Competition|Competition]], [[Lenses for Game Design - Lenses#44. Cooperation|Cooperation]], [[Lenses for Game Design - Lenses#45. Competition vs Cooperation|Competition vs Cooperation]] 

#### Short vs Long 
* Balance should take into account the length of the gameplay
* Too short and choices will not be meaningful enough. 
* Too long and the game may feel like too much of a time commitment. 
* *The main factors that affect the duration of the game are the win conditions*. 

#### Rewards
* Players are motivated by a certain desire that can be fulfilled by the game. 
* *Games judge players, but they should judge them fairly*. 
* The [[Players and Why We Play Games#Rewards|following]] are some examples of rewards: *We balance the rewards by controlling which are given out and when*. 
	* Rule of thumb: More rewards = better 
	* Rewards have diminishing returns. People have a tendency to get acclimated to rewards the more they receive them. 
	* Favor variable rewards over fixed rewards. 
	* *Rewards are generally a better tool for reinforcement than punishment*. If you need to encourage something, use a reward. 
* Relevant Lenses: [[Lenses for Game Design - Lenses#46. Reward|Reward]]

#### Punishment 
* The [[Players and Why We Play Games#Rewards and Punishments|following]] show examples of punishments. 
* Be careful with setting punishments in game. Balance them by *making them reasonable.*
	* *Punish the player for things that they are able to understand and prevent* Otherwise, the player will feel like they are not in control.
	* Punishments that are unfair have their place for players who are motivated by challenges. However, even these players must be able to see how they can prevent the punishment. 
* A combination of light punishments is enough to encourage certain behaviors. 

* Relevant Lenses: [[Lenses for Game Design - Lenses#47. Punishment|Punishment]]

#### Freedom vs Controlled Experience 
* There is a [[Trade Offs#Freedom of Choice Trade-Off|trade off]]  in giving the player freedom of choice. Not only that, but it is extra work for the designers in giving the player more options.
* Consider *where to give the player freedom and how much freedom to give*. 

#### Simple vs Complex 
* There are two kinds of complexity in a game: 
	* **Innate Complexity** - when the very rules of the game are complex. *Generally bad because it makes the rules convoluted*. 
		* If there are a lot of exceptions to the rule, then there is innate complexity. 
	* **Emergent Complexity** - when simple rules give rise to complex phenomena. *[[Games as Rules#Emergent Systems|Emergence]] is good*. 

* There are two kinds of balancing
	* **Artificial Balancing** - adding more rules and more innate complexity to balance the game. 
	* **Natural Balancing** - the desired effects emerge naturally from the game. 

* ***Elegance** arises from simple systems that perform robustly in complex situations. Elegant game elements are those that serve many purposes*.  
	* Whenever possible, favor removing something or using something that already exists than adding something new. 
* *Elegance is balanced with character*. Too much elegance makes the game too simple. *Adding character entails adding lovable, quirky elements that make the game unique*.
	* Elegance is simplicity. Character is complexity. Both are needed.

#### Detail vs Imagination 
* Decide exactly what details should be provided, and which should be provided to the player's imagination
* Some tips or how to do it well:
	* *Only detail what you can do well.* When you cannot detail it in high fidelity, use the player's imagination to do the detailing for you. 
	* *Give details the imagination can use* - Give details that the player can easily understand. This serves to introduce [[Knowledge in the Head and In the World|knowledge]] that is easily parsed.
	* *Familiar things do not need much detail*. The imagination cannot help when the player is not familiar with the setting. 
	* *The binocular effect*. Use a little detail to get a lot of imagination. Briefly show a detailed view then zoom out and let the imagination take care of the rest. 
	* *Give details that inspire imagination*. Appeal to the player's fantasy. 

* Relevant Lenses:  [[Lenses for Game Design - Lenses#51. Imagination|Imagination]]

#### How to Balance a Game 
* Use the [[Lenses for Game Design - Lenses#8 . Problem Solving|lens of the problem statement]]. Balancing is a [[Design|design issue]]. 
* *Double and halve*. That is, narrow down the parameters of the game by doing a binary search. Push the values farther than what intuition tells us.
	* *Change something so that you can feel the difference right away*. 
* *Train your intuition by guessing exactly*. 
* *Document the model* Write down what you think the relationships are between the things being balanced. This helps clarify things and gives a framework to record results of balancing. 
* *Tune the model as you tune the game*. Essentially, follow [[Science|the scientific method]].
* *Plan to balance*. Put systems that make it easy to change the values you expect to balance. A variation of [[Lenses for the Process#The Game Improves through Iteration|iteration]].
* *Most of the time, the players shouldn't balance the game*.  The players are biased-- they want to win and poor balance may help with that. 
	* However, take into account player feedback. 
* *Beware the pitfalls of dynamic game balancing* -- that is, difficulty that adjusts to the players. This is not to say it is unviable, but that it comes with its own challenges. 
	* *It spoils the reality of the world.* If the abilities of their opponents are relative to the player, then the illusion that they are fixed challenges to be mastered disappears .
	* *It is exploitable*. If the game gets easier when they play badly, they may just play badly to make the game easy. 
	* *Players improve with practice*.
