* **Absolute Control** - One player has Absolute Control of an area.
	* Controlled territories typically only contain one player’s units, and other players are barred from co-existing in that territory
	* It’s important to know who controls the space, because the space occupied provides benefits, gives access to certain abilities, or produces resources.
	* Many games allow players to control a territory even though they have evacuated the units within it.
	* Consider how areas change control.

* **Area Majority / Influence** - Multiple players may occupy a space and gain benefits based on their proportional presence in the space.
	* While some games allow fluidity to the states of control a territory may exhibit, other games have moments where control must crystallize and resolve in some way

* **Troop Types** - To compete for or establish control requires troops, inhabitants, influence, presence, or some similar metaphor for being in a place
	* In the context of area majority games, the simplest distinction between unit types is their power
	* In the context of absolute control, some differences in troop types are tied to the [[Tabletop Mechanics -- Uncertainty|uncertainty]] engine that resolves combat

* **Territories and Regions** - Maps can exhibit hierarchical relationships among their constituent spaces such that a territory might exist in a region and various attributes and parameters may be tied to the control of these areas.
	* Regional effects provide opportunities to bring a setting to life by providing narrative and mechanical events that differentiate the Territories from one another.

* **Area Parameters** - Parameters are assigned to regions that impact why players might wish to control them and how they need to allocate resources to do so.
	* The most common Area Parameters are the rewards gained for controlling areas.
	* Can also include terrain and advantages or disadvantages for attacking and defending
	* Another Area Parameter is unit limits per region.

* **Force Projection** - Force Projection is the impact of the [[Tabletop Mechanics -- Movement|movement]], attack, and other abilities of units on the decision-making of your opponent.

* **Zone Control** - Spaces adjacent to a unit impact the ability of opposing units to move or attack.
	* It allows the designer to reduce the unit density and to still allow players to form lines with gaps that enemies cannot simply move through without consequence.
	* ZOC can also be created more organically by allowing units to take opportunity attacks against units that move adjacent to them or past them or that begin a move next to them but move away.

* **Line of Sight** - Units may only see certain areas.
	* Line of Sight is a type of Force Projection in that it controls which areas of the board a unit may impact.
	* The simplest mechanism is to have a range and trace the shortest path of spaces to the target. Occlusions may block line of sight.
	* Increased accuracy in LOS comes at the cost of fiddliness in terms of moving pieces. 
	* LOS may also need to account for changes in elevation. 
	* LOS usually interferes with force projection, so blocking LOS is a tool in the designer’s toolkit for modifying the way in which certain units shape the battlefield and the options players have for navigating it.
