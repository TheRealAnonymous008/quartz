* **Set Valuation** - the logic or underlying mathematical model by which designers assign values to sets of game elements. Set Valuation can be in terms of currency, resources, or victory points.
	* *Sets do not increase their value in a linear fashion*. 
	* One valuation scheme: elements are worth nothing except when they are part of a completed set.
	* Another variation: singleton cards have some value of their own but more value when part of a complete set.
	* Consider **termination** -- determine how big the sets can be.
	* It opens up some strategies during play
		* When sets have a maximum size and/or score, players are incentivized to diversify and collect multiple types of sets.
		* When sets are not limited, players are wiser to specialize.
		* Strategies are influenced by the valuation of each set, and the existence of orthogonal sets (sets that are independent of each other)
	* When sets can increase in size and value, a designer can use a variety of progressions to score increasingly larger sets

* **Tile Laying** - Set-collection mechanisms with spatial elements
	* Has aspects of [[Tabletop Mechanics -- Area Control|Area Majority]]. 
	* Tile-Laying introduces ideas of adjacency and spatial relationships to sets, either as new requirements for set validity or as buffs and nerfs to the valuation of sets.

* **Grid Coverage** - A family of mechanisms in which players cover a grid or fill a space using a variety of shapes.
	* Grid-Coverage games donâ€™t always involve set-collection in any recognizable way

* **Network Building** - a specialized kind of set collection in which the sets collected represent ties between nodes, often represented as routes between destinations.
	* Route-building games typically make routes permanent and allow those routes to be reused as part of other sets or to be subsumed entirely into a larger set.
	* Can be augmented with additional mechanics such as terrain or blocking other players.
	* Consider how the network is created
		* **Point-to-Point** - the map is a regular grid of dots or connections, and players may connect any two adjacent dots. 
			* Such connections can either be owned by a player or usable by all.
			* They work well when there are a lot of possible connections per node.
		* **Tile Placement** - players place (typically) square or hexagonal tiles onto a grid to form connections. 
			* Allows for more complex tiles, tiles that go under or over others, or branch off.
			* Allows for [[Tabletop Mechanics -- Economics|Upgrade systems]] where tiles are replaced for more complex or valuable tiles.
		* **Existing Network** - routes are already printed. Players need to claim, construct or activate them in some way.
			* Advantageous when stereotypical connections are always made.
	* Often these mechanism are the centerpiece of the design.

* **Combo Abilities** - A collection of Abilities that are acquired separately and synergize together.
	* Combos are an emergent aspect of gameplay.
	* Usually requires the game to have a modular approach to actions.
	* Typically needs to have a few types of resources, and a variety of domains within which game elements can exist.
	* Made more dynamic with [[Tabletop Mechanics -- Turn Order and Structure|open turn structures]] and more options for how to play.
	* Can introduce a sense of discovery in players if "sets" are not explicitly constructed. Players create their own "sets" whose elements synergize well with each other.
