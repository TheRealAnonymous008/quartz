* **Standard Worker Placement** - Players select actions, in turn order, by placing a worker from their supply on a building associated with a specific action and then execute that action immediately.
	* The round ends when all workers have been placed, at which point they return to their owners’ pools and a new round begins.
	* Turn order is typically set by placing a worker on a building that grants turn order priority.
	* Increasing the number of actions that may be taken in a turn is themed as getting new workers, which is an action tied to a building.
	* Maintenance costs are represented as feeding or paying for your workers.

* **Workers of Differing Types** - Workers can differ in abilities, or can be upgraded and downgraded, or are valid for placement in different areas and buildings.

* **Acquiring and Losing Workers** - Workers beyond the original complement may be acquired in some manner, either temporarily or permanently. Workers may also be lost as the game progresses.
	* These new workers represent substantial growth in a player’s overall action budget, and as such, acquiring more workers is often a dominant strategy.
		* This can be offset by upkeep costs or by requiring players to rehire the workers from a pool.
	* Other games actively encourage sacrificing workers for a benefit

* **Workers as Dice** - Workers are represented by dice whose pip values impact play
	* This approach leads to some analysis paralysis because of the large number of combinations that are possible
	* The manner in which the dice change values over the course of the game can vary.

* **Adding and Blocking Buildings** \
	* Buildings, and their corresponding actions, may be added to the pool of actions players may select from.
	* Buildings may also be occupied to prevent or hinder players from accessing those actions.
		* Worker placement is a kind of action [[Tabletop Mechanics -- Cards|drafting]], and drafting denotes a dwindling set of possible choices. Thus, players can block other players from a building.
		* **Bumping**, allows an occupied building to be reused, but the worker currently occupying the building is removed, and the owner gains some kind of bonus.

* **Single Workers** - Players control only a Single primary Worker and cannot acquire more workers.
	* Can be similar too [[Tabletop Mechanics -- Actions|Rondel]] or [[Tabletop Mechanics -- Turn Order and Structure|Time track games]] 
	* Blocking is still a part of these games.

* **Building Actions and Rewards** - Buildings can offer varying rewards to different players, based on ownership and turn order, or they may be upgraded to increase their rewards to all players.\
	* One way buildings can vary in rewards is through improvements of different kinds
	* Buildings and spaces may also increase in value over time until a player selects them. 
	* Conversely, buildings may become deactivated or hindered. 

* **Turn Order and Resolution Order** - Worker placement is ultimately a drafting mechanism, and the order by which actions are selected and resolved is an opportunity for design variations.
	* See [[Tabletop Mechanics -- Turn Order and Structure|turn order]] and [[Tabletop Mechanics -- Resolution|resolution]] mechanisms as well.
	* One approach is to have a building grant turn order priority. This gives strong left-to-right binding as players are advantaged or disadvantaged due to turn order.
	* Another approach is to use [[Tabletop Mechanics -- Auctions|auctions]] to determine turn order.
	* One design consideration is to determine when worker actions get placed versus when they get resolved.
	* Another consideration is when workers return to the pool.
		* Spending a turn to retrieve workers introduces blocking.
