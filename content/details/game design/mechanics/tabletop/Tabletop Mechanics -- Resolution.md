* **High Number** - Each player is represented by a numeric “strength,” and the higher strength wins the conflict.
	* Strength can be fixed or random. 
	* Strength can be a stat that is modified. However, doing so increases complexity, especially if modifiers can come from multiple sources.
	* Another common pattern is **Attrition-based Mechanics** where the difference in strength is dealt as "damage" to the losing side.
	* In numeric comparison systems, some means to deal with ties need to be included

* **Stat Check** - There is a target number required to succeed at some tests. A random number is generated, which is compared to the target. If it meets or exceeds the target, the action succeeds.
	* Consider how the random number is generated (by card draw, die roll, etc.).
	* Can be combined with High Number resolution for compact and fluid resolution.
	* Stats can be modified, but doing so increases complexity, especially if modifiers can come from multiple sources.

* **Critical Hits and Failures** - Dice are rolled, and those exceeding a target number generate success. Certain rolls (typically the highest and/or lowest on the die) generate additional success or extreme failure.
	* Adds [[Random Variables and Probability Distributions|variance]] to the resolution system and thus creates excitement and tension.
	* Some games can [[Game Economy|convert]] special symbols into a type of currency. These **Surges** can give tactical tools for players.

* **Combat Table Results** - The Attacker and Defender each total their strength. This is then expressed as a ratio and is used to index into a Combat Results Table (CRT). A dice roll then determines the result of the conflict.
	* Gives a greater degree of control to the designer especially since they control the distribution of effects. 
	* Some make use of the differential between Attacker and Defender instead of the ratio, but this can result in a sense of "unrealism" since a 10-8 is treated the same as a 3-1. It can, however, give a lighter feel to the game.
	* They can be intimidating and tedious to use.

* **Die Icons** - The player rolls dice, and any die showing the target icon is a success
	* Using an icon makes it simpler for players to interpret the result, if they are properly chosen
	* The distribution of icons also gives the designer fine-grained control over possible combat outcomes and allows for multiple effects to be determined
	* It is very difficult to deal with modifiers or other ways to modify attacks based on
		* One solution is to have dice of different qualities relating to power and skill. The dice can be segregated into different types. This gives the designer control over possible outcomes and makes it simple to interpret. 
	* One extreme of this is having die icons for every character. This can increase complexity.
	* Icons can be placed on cards to be flipped for resolution as well

* **Card Play** - Each player simultaneously or sequentially plays one or more cards. These modify the base outcome of a conflict and allow various special abilities to apply.
	* This resolution system places more control in the hands of the players.
	* The disadvantage of the more sophisticated card-based systems is that they slow down play quite a bit as battles are resolved
	* These systems can offer enormous design opportunities, and the ability to model a wide range of thematic moments and stratagems

* **Rock Paper Scissors** - Options are cyclically superior.
	* Adding intransitive elements to conflict resolution leads to interesting and novel decisions for the players.
	* The RPS mechanism can also arise indirectly from the interaction of player choices. The interactions and choices can get complex for players to decide, while being easy to resolve.

* **Prisoner's Dilemma** - Each player has a choice between Cooperating or Defecting. The total payoff is maximized if both players Cooperate, but if one Defects and the other Cooperates, the Defector will score more individual points.
	* See an extension [[Dynamic Games of Incomplete Information|here]].
	* Brings an element of trust and betrayal.

* **Alternate Removal** - The player with fewer units removes one. Then players alternate removing units until reaching a set number, one player is out of units, or some other stopping mechanism.
	* If players have equal numbers of tokens, the tied players each remove a token at the same time
	* It is strictly deterministic. It is a [[Static Games of Complete Information|deterministic process with no hidden information]].
	* Coexistence in an area is allowed and common. It allows for players to negotiate and settle borders.
	* It gives the design hooks for special abilities later in the game

* **Physical Action** - A Physical Action needs to be performed by one or more players to determine the outcome of the action.
	* Adds a skill-based, physical element to the play experience.
	* It adds a degree of randomness proportional to skill.
	* **Speed Matching** -  Cards are flipped up, and players need to see if two match, and either slap the cards or grab a totem
	* Introducing a physical action gives the designer a chance to add physical handicaps to mix up the challenges and make them harder. 
	* It gives games a lighter feel.

* **Static Capture** - Pieces are captured when another piece occupies or passes over their space.
	* Combined with a [[Tabletop Mechanics -- Movement|Movement system]]. 
	* In order to make capturing challenging and meaningful, the movement of pieces needs to be restricted in some fashion
		* In most cases, the moving piece will make the capture on its final space of movement
		* Motion is not a requirement

* **Enclosure** - Players try to surround pieces or key areas.
	* The nature of Enclosure games makes certain regions of the board more or less desirable
	* They are combined with some form of [[Tabletop Mechanics -- Area Control|area control]]
	* In general, good enclosure games are designed so that pieces are both trying to enclose and at risk of being enclosed themselves, or there are several possible ways they can be used for Enclosure.

* **Minimap** - When a conflict is initiated, pieces are moved to a separate board for resolution (using other resolution mechanics)

* **Force Commitment** - The players select how many of their forces they will commit to the battle to different categories. The players then reveal their assignments and resolve (using other resolution mechanics)
	* Also has elements of [[Tabletop Mechanics -- Auctions|auction-based mechanics]]. 
	* Uncertainty is a critical element of this mechanic since it requires players to guess how much other players are willing to commit 
	* These types of systems give the players a lot of flexibility in the goals they want to achieve

* **Voting** - Players vote on whether a proposed action will occur or not
	* Analogous to a [[Tabletop Mechanics -- Area Control|area control game]] where "area" is really the space of diplomatic alliances.
	* Voting can be done at various levels of the game (from micro to tactical to macro)
	* Some games have players vote on actual changes to the rules themselves
	* Encourages diplomacy and negotiation
	* Can be very time consuming because of negotiation.

* **Player Judge** - One player, the judge, decides the outcome of the Action.
	* The Judge is used when there is no objective criteria for a task.
	* In these games, the role of Judge either rotates around the table in a regular fashion or passes to the player who won the last round.
	* The Judge cannot score during the round they play. To balance this, give the winner of last round the role of Judge so that other players can catch up.
	* This system should have anonymous responses to remove any bias from the judge.

* **Targeted Clues** - A player gives clues that he or she wants some, but not all, players to guess
	* Used in light social games.

* **Tiebreakers** - If a resolution results in a tie, players look to an alternate means to break it.
	* **Resource Tiebreaker** - The player with the most or least of a particular resource will break the tie.
	* **Positional Tiebreaker** -  The player in a specific position in the turn order, or on a track, will break the tie
		* Most often ties go to the defender, but in some games that want to encourage aggression, ties may go to the attacker
		* If the tiebreaker is tied to a chosen player, then negotiation elements come into play.
	* **Random Tiebreaker** - Players roll off or use some other randomization means to break the tie. This can be exciting but time-consuming
		* If players are tied at the end of the game, breaking the tie randomly will be unsatisfying for players.
	* **Secondary Values** - Components have a unique secondary value that is used to break ties.
	* Tiebreakers for final victory should reward the players who have had a harder route to win

* **Dice Selection** - A player rolls multiple dice and selects one based on a rule. 
	* The common implementation is to select the highest and lowest dice.
		* A High/Low selection is a way for designers to skew single die results fairly significantly toward the high or low end.
		* Alternatively, a median selection system makes extreme results unlikely

* **Action Speed** - Actions are rated for speed or initiative. Faster actions are executed first. A generalization of this is that actions have a certain priority, higher priority actions are done first.
	* Most common in Simultaneous [[Tabletop Mechanics -- Game Structure|Action systems]].  Typically, if actions have the same speed, they are resolved simultaneously. Alternatively, use a tiebreaker.
	* Speed is another resource for balancing (i.e., Faster actions are weaker.)

* **Rerolling and Locking** - Dice may be rerolled or may be locked, preventing rerolling.
	* Typical characteristics (i.e., like in Yahtzee)
		* Dice may be rerolled or may be locked, preventing rerolling.
		* You can reroll dice regardless of whether they were rerolled or not
	* The player is choosing whether to reroll or not. This gives them finer-grained control and gives more tactical nuance to the act of rolling than just gaining a set modifier
	* Rerolls can result in the final result being worse than the initial roll
	* A combination of Rerolling and Locking encourages a "Push your Luck" dynamic.

* **Kill Steal** - Players contribute toward completing a task, but only the player who finally completes it gets a benefit.

* **Hot Potato** - Players strive to rid themselves of an item that will incur a massive penalty when it is triggered but can only dispose of the item by passing it to other players.
	* The dynamics of this system are good for either Player Elimination or Single Loser games.
	* It can also encourage bluffing (for example, convincing other players you do not have the Hot Potato)

* **Flicking** - Players use a finger or cue to strike a token and propel it toward a target
	* Flicking games can test various skills
		* Accuracy - if the player can flick the token to a specific spot or through obstacles.
		* Control - if the player can flick the token such that it stays in a certain area.
		* Power - if the player can flick the token as far as possible. 
	* In many flicking games, players stand and move around the play surface to find the right angle from which to take their shots
	* There can be a sharp skill gap between players
	* The most important aspect of flicking design is the physicality of the game. The object being flicked, the method of flicking, and the surface being flicked on must be carefully selected.
	* Because of its physical nature, it has a high degree of customizability. Players can assemble their own levels.
	* Flicking can be used as an abstract combat mechanic.

* **Stacking and Balancing** - Players must add, remove, or rearrange objects from a stack, a balancing contraption, or a playing surface.
	* Dexterity mechanisms generally test both physical skill and the ability to evaluate the consequences of the physical act
	* The objects to be stacked could be uniform or come in a variety of shapes and sizes.
		* Uniform objects can typically achieve higher heights.
		* Non-uniform objects are more interested in players figuring out how the objects can support each other
	* Typically dexterity mechanics take center stage. Mixing it with strategy may make players frustrated since they may expect either dexterity or strategy to take important but the following may occur (there are exceptions)
		* Strategy can fail due to a lack of dexterity
		* Dexterity can fail when the physicality is sidelined with tactics.
	* These games can incorporate "Push your Luck" mechanics
	* Balancing games often include a central contraption whose instability defines the underlying physics of the game
	* Accessibility is a design consideration. 

* **Neighbor Scope** - Actions, resources, or resolutions are shared between neighbors.
	* By restricting the interactions a player needs to worry about, it is easier to scale the game to higher player counts.
	* Thoughtful consideration of action scope allows the designer to control complexity, decision space, and player interaction.
	* At larger player counts, players often do not need to interact, even socially, with players other than their neighbors. The end result is a more fragmented rather than cohesive group experience
