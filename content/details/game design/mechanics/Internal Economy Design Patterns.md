* These design patterns can be combined with each other, often even driving entire game genres. 
* Patterns can be **elaborated** that is, made more complex to add more complexity and meaningfulness to the game.  
* Additionally, patterns can be **simplified** to either understand the complex design better or to remove unwanted  complexity entirely (especially for mechanics that are not the focus) 
* *The goal of these design patterns is to understand gameplay mechanics, and in particular what can make them interesting*. 
* These design patterns can be applied both in the micro and macro scale. 
## Engines 
* Generate resources that may be required by other mechanisms in the game. It represents gain.

* [[Static Engine]]
* [[Dynamic Engine]]
* [[Converter Engine]]
* [[Engine Building]]

## Friction 
* Drains resources from the economy, reduces its productivity or both. It represents loss 

* [[Static Friction]] 
* [[Dynamic Friction]]
* [[Stopping Mechanism]]
* [[Attrition]]

## Escalation 
* Put pressure on the player to deal with growing challenges.

* [[Escalating Challenge]]
* [[Escalating Complexity]]
* [[Arms Race]]

## Miscellaneous Patterns
* [[Playing Style Reinforcement]]
* [[Multiple Feedback]]
* [[Trade]] 
* [[Worker Placement]]
* [[Slow Cycle]]
