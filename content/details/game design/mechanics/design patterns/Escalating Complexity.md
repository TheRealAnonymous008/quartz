* *Intent*: Players act against growing complexity, trying to keep the game under control until positive feedback grows too strong and the accumulated complexity makes them lose.
* *Motivation*: Complexity contributes to the difficulty of the task. Escalating complexity means that eventually players can no longer keep up and eventually lose.
# Applicability
* You aim for a high-pressure skill-based game. 
* You want to create emergent mechanics that partially replace predesigned level progression.

* Complexity immediately increases the production of more complexity (a strong positive feedback loop that must be kept under control) 
* Player loses when they can no longer manage said complexity

# Considerations
* It typically involves and rewards player skill (until they can no longer keep up). When the game ends, it will end quickly. 
* It creates a game with a varied pace. 
* It can be combined with an [[Escalating Challenge]], which creates the progression mechanism. 
* It can serve as part of a [[Multiple Feedback]] structure.
