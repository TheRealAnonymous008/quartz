* *Intent*: Players actively steal or destroy resources of other players that they need for other actions in the game.
* *Motivation*: By allowing players to directly steal or destroy each otherâ€™s resources, players can eliminate each other in a struggle for dominance.
# Applicability
* You want to allow direct and strategic interaction between multiple players.
* You want to introduce feedback into a system whose nature is determined by the strategic preferences and/or whims of the players.

* By performing attack actions, players can drain each other's strength. It may or may not also cost strength to perform. 
* If the attack doesn't cost strength, it must involve something to offset the advantage (for example skill or randomness). 

# Considerations
* The dominance resulting from attrition is dependent on a balance between attack costs, effectiveness, and how beneficial other actions in the game are. 
* Makes the system more dynamic and can introduce destructive feedback. Players may be stimulated to either attack stronger or weaker players. 

* Players should be required to invest some resource in attacking that could also be spent elsewhere. Otherwise, the game becomes a race with no strategic choice. 
* Attacks without investment works better in social games because players need to choose whom to attack.
* Commonly implemented with "life" and "energy" . But these two must be related. 
* Other actions (that are not attacking) typically constitute a production mechanism for strength. 

* When there is a bonus for attacking or eliminating players, the pattern can be made to stimulate the elimination of weaker players.

* It elaborates the [[Dynamic Friction]] pattern.
