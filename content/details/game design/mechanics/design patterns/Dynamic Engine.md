* *Intent*: A source produces an adjustable flow of resources. Players can invest resources to improve the flow.
* *Motivation*: A dynamic engine produces a steady flow of resources and opens the possibility for long-term investment by allowing the player to spend resources to improve production. The core of a dynamic engine is a positive constructive feedback loop.

# Applicability 
* You want to introduce a [[Trade Offs|trade off]] between short term goals and long-term investment. 
* You want the player to be be able to control the production rate more so than a regular [[Static Engine]]

* Energy is produced and consumed by an action. Optionally, we can invest to produce upgrades that will improve the energy output of the engine. 
* Upgrades can either be for 
	* the production rate  - higher = steadier flow of energy 
	* the number of energy units produced - higher = bursts of energy 

# Considerations
* Requires balancing the feedback loop using a negative feedback loop.
* Requires considerations as to not creating a dominant strategy where either long-term or short-term strategy is strongly favored. This can be balanced by using an appropriate [[Game Theory - Games|discounting factor]] that indicates long term investment has diminishing returns 
* Characterized by players investing first and then beyond a certain point, the player will make more progress and try to do so at the quickest pace. 
 
* The positive feedback loop amplifies early wins which can lead to instability.  This can be balanced out by stabilizing the production rate. 
* *Upgrades can be converted back to energy* but at a lower rate than the original investment. This becomes viable when upgrades are expensive and there is a frequent need for large amounts of energy.
