* *Intent*: This is a mechanism that cycles through different states slowly, creating periodic changes to the game’s mechanics.
# Applicability
* You want to create more variation by introducing periodic phases to the game.
* You want to counteract the dominance of a particular strategy.
* You want to force players to periodically adapt strategies to shifting circumstances.
* You want to require a longer period of learning before achieving mastery of the game (Players experience slow cycles less frequently, so have fewer opportunities to learn from them)
* You want to introduce subtle, indirect strategic interaction by allowing players to influence the cycle’s period or amplitude.
