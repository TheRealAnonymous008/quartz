* *Intent*: A drain automatically consumes resources produced by the player.
* *Motivation*: It counters a production mechanism by periodically consuming resources. 
# Applicability
* You want to create a mechanism that counters production but can eventually be overcome by the players 
* You want to exaggerate the long-term benefits from investing in upgrades for a [[Dynamic Engine]].

* The production mechanism produces energy that players need to use to perform action. It does so outside of the players' direct control. 
# Considerations
* It is a simple way to counter an engine pattern. However, it tends to emphasize long term strategies since it does not affect any countermeasures such as upgrades (from dynamic engines) 

* Consumption rate can be fixed or random.  When it is fixed, it is more predictable.
* Random consumption rates can be a good alternative to random production rates. 
* When there is a continual loss of energy, the system's dynamics is less strong. Whereas, if there is a periodic loss (at irregular intervals), the system becomes more unstable.
