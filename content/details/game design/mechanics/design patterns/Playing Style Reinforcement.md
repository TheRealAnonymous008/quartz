* *Intent*: By applying slow, positive, constructive feedback on player actions, the game encourages specialization and gradually adapts to the playerâ€™s preferred playing style.
* *Motivation*: Slow positive, constructive feedback on player actions cause the player to develop over time. Over time, the player avatar and units will reflect player preferences  
# Applicability 
* You want players to make a long-term investment in the game that spans multiple play sessions.
* You want to reward players for building, planning ahead, and developing personal strategies.
* You want players to grow into a specific role or strategy.

* Ability affects the success rate of actions 
* Attempting actions generates experience points or directly improves abilities. Some games require the action to be successful, while others do not. 
* Experience points might be spent to improve abilities 
# Considerations
* Best suited for games over multiple play sessions, for games with multiple strategies and play styles. 
* It can inspire min-maxing behavior. However, if min-maxing is successful, it usually becomes a dominant strategy.
* It favors experienced over inexperienced players because the former have a better understanding of the game. 
* It rewards players who (are willing to) play longer.  
* It can be ineffective for a player to change strategies over time in a game with playing style reinforcement, because the player will lose the benefit of previous investments in another play style.

* *Consider if experience points are necessary*
	* When using them, there is no direct coupling between growth and action, allowing harvesting of experience. 
	* When not using them, make sure feedback is balanced for the frequency of the actions. More frequent actions should give weaker feedback. 

* Use [[Escalating Challenge]], [[Dynamic Friction]] or [[Stopping Mechanism]] to balance them. 

* *Decide whether the action needs to be executed successfully to generate the feedback*. 
	* When success is required, the feedback loop gains influence and the difficulty of the player's tasks also affects the success of an action. 
	* When success is not required, players have more options to improve neglected abilities during later and more difficult stages, but it might encourage players to perform an action at every conceivable opportunity (be wary when the action has little risk)
