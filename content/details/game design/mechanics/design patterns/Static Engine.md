* *Intent*: Produces a steady flow of resources over time for players to consume or to collect while playing the game.
* *Motivation*: Creates a steady flow of resources that never dries up 
# Applicability
* You want to limit playersâ€™ actions without complicating the design. A static engine forces players to think how they are going to spend their resources without much need for long-term planning.

* The source produces energy at a fixed or unpredictable rate 
# Considerations
* The production rate does not change. Its effects on game balance are predictable. 
* Can cause imbalance only when its production rate is not the same for all players 
* Generally doesn't inspire long term strategies. Resource collection is quite obvious 

* *Increase unpredictability to encourage the players to plan*. This can be achieved by 
	* Using a varying production rate 
	* Varying the output level of resources 
	* Varying the length of time between moments of production 
	* Using skill or multiplayer dynamics
