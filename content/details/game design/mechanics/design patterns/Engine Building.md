* *Intent*: A significant portion of gameplay is dedicated to building up and tuning an engine to create a steady flow of resources.
* *Motivation*: The game should offer multiple mechanics to improve the design of the engine. 
# Applicability
* You want to create a game that has a strong focus on building and construction 
* You want the game to focus on long-term strategy and planning 
# Participants

* The building mechanisms increase the output of the core engine (which can be any engine)
* If energy is required to activate building mechanisms, then a positive, constructive feedback loop is created.

# Considerations
* Best suited for games with high intended difficulty or those that are slower paced / focus on strategy. 

* It should be difficult to assess the engine's state. 
* Introduce unpredictability to increase difficulty, variety, and the size of the strategy space.  The core engine's complexity also introduces unpredictability. 
* Spread the process of engine building over the entire game. 

* It can *operate without feedback* when energy is not required for the building mechanisms. This gives the player more strategy over which resources to prioritize, however the building mechanisms should be restricted in some way. 
* Has more upgrades than a [[Dynamic Engine]]
