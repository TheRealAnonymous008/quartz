* *Intent*: Progress toward a goal increases the difficulty of further progression.
* *Motivation*: It makes it harder for players as they get closer to achieving their goals. The game adapts to the player's skill level, especially when good performance would allow the player to progress more quickly.
# Applicability
* You want to create a fast paced game based on player skill in which the game gets harder as the player advances.  
* You want to create emergent mechanics that partially replace predesigned level progression.

* The task reduces targets, produces progress, or does both. The feedback mechanic increases the difficulty of the task as the player gets closer to achieving the goal.

# Considerations 
* Based on a simple positive feedback loop affecting difficulty. If failure ends the game, the escalating challenge ends the game quickly. 
* Usually the escalating challenge is affected by player skill. 
* Works well in a more complex game. It can be combined with [[Escalating Complexity]]
