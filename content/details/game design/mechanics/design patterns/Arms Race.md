* Attack mechanisms allow players to drain or steal each other's strengths 
* Activating the attack mechanisms require investments in energy or time. 
* Upgrades can be used for both offense, defense or to restore player's strength. 

# Considerations
* Introduces many strategic options for players to explore which can make balancing difficult. Every strategy must have a counter-strategy. 
* Mechanisms that players don't like are usually ignored. 
* Arms races can delay confrontation and conflict for a long time, prolonging gameplay. 

* Consider *what are required for the upgrades*. 
	* When energy and strength are the same. Players may accidentally over-invest and make themselves vulnerable, especially if upgrades take time. 
	* When energy is separate from strength, their actual relationship needs to be determined. 
* *Make resources for activating upgrades heavily contested*. This prevents the game from taking too long 
* *It can be asymmetrical* but this means the game is more difficult to balance.
