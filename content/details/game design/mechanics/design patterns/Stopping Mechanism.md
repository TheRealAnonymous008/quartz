* *Intent*: Reduce the effectiveness of a mechanism every time it is activated.
* *Motivation*: Prevent the player from abusing a powerful mechanism by virtue of the Law of Diminishing returns. 
# Applicability 
* You want to prevent players from abusing particular actions 
* You want to counter dominant strategies 
* You want to reduce the effectiveness of a positive feedback mechanism 

# Participants

* An action must have an energy cost, produce a resource or both. The stopping mechanism reduces the effectiveness of an action mechanism every time it is activating by increasing costs or reducing the output of resources. 

# Considerations
* It reduces the effect of a positive feedback loop considerably and even make its return insufficient. 

* It is sometimes permanent but usually not.
	* When the accumulated output is used to measure the strength of the stopping mechanism, the effects are not permanent. 
	* Non-permanent stopping mechanisms mean players have to alternate between using actions. 
* If the stopping mechanism can apply to multiple players, the game will reward players that can use the action first.
