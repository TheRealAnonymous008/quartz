# Callois' Typology of Ludic Activities
* **Agon** - competitive play. Combat is artificially created and adversaries confront each other.
* **Alea** - chance based play. All games that are based on a decision independent of the player.
* **Mimicry** - role playing and make-believe play. One becomes an illusory character. The play of representation
* **Ilinx** - playing with the physical sensation, with the goal of momentarily destroying the stability of perception.
* **Paida** - wild, free-form improvisational play. 
* **Ludus** - rule bound, regulated formalized play.

# Leblanc's Typology of Fun 
* **Sensation** - games as sensory pleasure
* **Fantasy** - games as make-believe
* **[[Narrative]]** - games as drama
* **Challenge** - games as an obstacle course.
* **Fellowship** - games as a social framework for cooperation and community
* **Discovery** - games as exploring uncharted territory.
* **Expression** - games as self-discovery and as opportunities for creating things.
* **Submission** - games as masochism -- the pleasure of submitting to the formal system of the [[The Fundamentals of Game Design|magic circle]].

# Apter's Typology of Fun 
* **Exposure to Arousing Stimulation** - intense and overwhelming sensation.
* **Fiction and Narrative** - emotional arousal from character identification
* **Challenge** - difficulties and frustrations arising from competition.
* **Exploration** - moving off into new territory.
* **Negativism** - deliberate rule-breaking.
* **Cognitive Synergy** - imaginative play.
* **Facing Danger** - risk within the protective framework of play.

# Sutton-Smith's Typology
* Within the system of social relationships, *players can assume a variety of roles*.  Players may be actors or counteractors
* *Play emerges directly from the relationships between players*.
* Sutton-Smith gives the following motives and what the actors / counter-actors perform:
	* **Race** - to overtake / stay ahead
	* **Chase** - to catch / elude
	* **Attack** - to overpower / defend
	* **Capture** - to take / avoid being taken
	* **Harassment** - to tease, taunt or lure / to see through, move suddenly, or bide time.
	* **Search** - to find / to hide
	* **Rescue** - to spring prisoner / to guard against escape
	* **Seduction** - to tempt another forbidden action / to resist.

# Bartle's Player Typology  
* Another typology from Bartle, applicable especially in MUDs.  Some can be related to [[#Leblanc's Typology of Fun]]
* **Achievers** - have the goal of point-gathering and rising in levels. They want to achieve the goals of the game. Their primary pleasure is challenge
* **Explorers** - delight in having the game expose its internal machinations to them. Their primary pleasure is discovery. 
* **Socializers** - to them, the game is a common backdrop that facilitates interaction with others. Their primary pleasure is fellowship.
* **Killers** - impose themselves on others. This includes destructive goals (i.e., griefing) but also helping others.

|         | Acting    | Interacting |
| ------- | --------- | ----------- |
| World   | Achievers | Explorers   |
| Players | Killers   | Socializers     |


# Typology by Age 
* All play activities are connected to childhood. Childhood is centered around play. To create games for a particular age, *you must speak the language of their childhood.*

| Label       | Age bracket | Likes                                                                                            | Dislikes                           |

# Typology by Sex 
* While [[False Priors and Extension Neglect|Stereotypical]], there is some reality behind the stereotypes that may be useful to the designer.

| Male                             | Female                                     |

| Destruction                      | Nurturing and Creation                     |
| Spatial Puzzles                  | Dialogue and Verbal Puzzles                |
| Trial and Error. Experimentation | Learning by Example                        |
| Emotions as a means to an end    | Emotions as an end                         |
| Abstract or Fantasy games        | Games grounded on the real world           |
| Single tasking                   | Multitasking                               |


# Additional Pleasures to Consider 
* From [[The Art of Game Design -- A Book of Lenses by Schell|Schell]]. 
* **Anticipation** -  when you know pleasure is coming, just waiting is a kind of pleasure 
* **Completion** - the pleasure in finishing something
* **Schadenfreude** - delighting in another's pleasure, particularly in competitive games. 
* **Gift giving** - making others happy through gifts.
* **Humor** - Two unconnected things are suddenly united by a paradigm shift. It is hard to describe, but we all know it when it happens. Weirdly, it causes us to make a barking noise. [^1]
* **Possibility** - the pleasure of having many [[Free Will|choices]].
* **Pride** - the pleasure that persists long after the achievement was made. 
* **Surprise** - [[General Story Writing Principles#Problem Keeping the Audience Surprised|keep the audience surprised]]
* **Thrill**  -the experience of terror juxtaposed with security.
* **Triumph** - the pleasure of accomplishing something that was difficult.

# Rewards and Punishments 
* *Games can judge us and give us rewards* which players will find pleasing 
* *Games can also judge us and give us punishment.
	* [[Lenses for Game Design - Lenses#7. Endogenous Value|Endogenous value]] is created when rewards can be taken away from us. 
	* Risks are exciting
	* The possibility of punishment invites challenge.

# The Social Reasons for Play 
* From [[The Art of Game Design -- A Book of Lenses by Schell|Schell]]. 

* **Competition** - It fill several kinds of needs 
	* Allows for a balanced playing field 
	* Provides a worthy opponent 
	* Gives an interesting problem to solve 
	* Fulfills a deep inner need to determine our skill relative to someone else in our social circle.
	* Allows for games involving complex strategy, choices, and psychology made possible by the intelligence of the opponent 
* **Collaboration** 
	* Allows partaking in game actions and strategies that are impossible with just one person. 
	* Let us enjoy the deep pleasure that comes from group problem solving. 
* **Meeting Up** 
	* Gives a convenient reason for people to be together 
	* Gives something to share 
	* Gives focus on things that won't make everyone uncomfortable. 
* **Exploring Our Friends** - when we play a game, we get a glimpse of the depths of our friends. 
* **Exploring Ourselves** - we also get to see how we would behave in a social situation under stress. 

* **Spectation** - games provide good social connection simply by watching people playing.
