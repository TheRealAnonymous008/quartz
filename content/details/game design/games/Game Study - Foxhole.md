* *Issue*: The wars do not last as long as intended. 
* *Solution*: Scale the world up and add another system that focuses on the grand strategic layer (analogous to a theatre of war)..  The goal is to make macro level decisions affect the micro-level tactics, and to make conflicts and the context behind them affect the war effort of both sides. 

* *Feature*: Support the idea of some form of player customization to support the ability to roleplay and "immerse" oneself in the world. This makes the characters more permanent.  
* *Feature*: The player profile reflects the player's actual skill. Rather than skills improving player abilities, player abilities determine these skills.
