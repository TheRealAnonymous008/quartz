# Pathfinding 
* **Crash and Turn** - pathfinding that aims to be human like. The idea is to have the agent run in a straight line towards a target until it hits an obstacle, in which case it turns to move around it until it can move into a straight line again. 

* **[Flow Fields](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R7W8LVvegk)** - an approach where an entire [[Linear Algebra|vector field]] is pre-computed. The vectors in this field indicate the direction that agents should move towards. 

* [Formation AI](https://github.com/EezehDev/AI-Formations) - the general idea is to move all units relative to a leader
