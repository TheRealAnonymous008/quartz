# Salen and Zimmerman's Model 
* There are three kinds of rules
	* **Operational** - the guidelines player require in order to play. The rules written out.
		* It concerns external, representational events that impact player interactivity.
	* **Constitutive** - the formal, logical, and mathematical structures underlying the game. The need not correspond to material form, but most likely correspond to relationships between items. 
		* They are concerned with the events corresponding to processing player choice rather than events that represent the choice.
	* **Implicit** - unwritten rules that concern etiquette, good sportsmanship and other implied rules of proper game behavior.
		* It also includes underlying assumptions. *Questioning Implicit rules can give good design ideas*.
	* *The Constitutive and Operational rules work together to generate the formal meaning of a game.*

# Parlett's Model
![[Parlett's Model of Rules.png]]

* **Operational Rules** - what the players do to play the game. 
* **Foundational Rules** - the underlying formal (mathematical ) structure of a game. 
* **Behavioral rules** - implicit to the gameplay but which are understood as part of good sportsmanship. 
* **Written rules** - the rules that come with the game as a written document. 
	* Video games have shied away from this because it is impossible to encode all the non-linearities. Instead, the game teaches the mechanics through interactive tutorials.
* **Laws** - only formed when games are played in serious competitive settings to clarify good sportsmanship or existing official written rules.
* **Official Rules** - created when a game is played seriously enough that a group of players feels the need to merge the written rules with laws. 
* **Advisory Rules** - tips to help play the game better, and not rules from a mechanics perspective. 
* **House Rules** - games that are defined by the players. They are created as a response to a perceived deficiency after a few rounds of play.
