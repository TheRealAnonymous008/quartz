* Machine Learning Methods generally require the following four components:
	* Data
	* Models 
	* [[Loss Function|Objective]]
	* [[Optimization Algorithms in Machine Learning]]. 

* The three classic paradigms are suited for different problems:
	* **[[Supervised Learning]]** - for finding functional mappings between features and labels. 
	* **[[Unsupervised Learning]]** - for understanding the underlying structure of the data . 
		* [[Contrastive Learning]]
	* **[[Reinforcement Learning]]** - for developing policies and behaviors. 

* Machine Learning models have **inductive biases** - assumptions that the model uses to perform a prediction task wherein the model prefers a certain class of solutions. 
* The **No Free Lunch Theorem** - any learning algorithm generalizes better on data with certain distributions and worse with other distributions. 

* [[Systems and Models|Machine Learning models can capture patterns within systems]].

# Tools
* [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co)- an open source platform provider of machine learning technologies. They also provide datasets.
* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) - a machine learning framework. *Opinon:* More developer friendly than TensorFlow
* [sentencepiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece)- a tokenizer that supports byte pair encoding. It allows ofr a purely end-to-end system that does not depend on language-specific pre/post-processing
* [tiktoken](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken)- a fast byte pair encoding tokenzier
