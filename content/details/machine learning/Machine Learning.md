* Machine Learning Methods generally require the following four components: Data, Models, Objectives, and Optimization Algorithms. 
* The three classic paradigms are suited for different problems:
	* **Supervised Learning** - for finding functional mappings between features and labels. 
	* **Unsupervised Learning** - for understanding the underlying structure of the data . 
	* **Reinforcement Learning** - for developing policies and behaviors. 

* The methods of Neural Style Transfer probably indicate that neural networks can extract the "essence" of an image in the same manner humans recognize an object even if it is rendered or perceived differently.

* Machine Learning models have **inductive biases** - assumptions that the model uses to perform a prediction task wherein the model prefers a certain class of solutions. 
* The **No Free Lunch Theorem** - any learning algorithm generalizes better on data with certain distributions and worse with other distributions.

# Tools
* [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co)- an open source platform provider of machine learning technologies. They also provide datasets.
* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) - a machine learning framework. *Opinon:* More developer friendly than TensorFlow
* [sentencepiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece)- a tokenizer that supports byte pair encoding. It allows ofr a purely end-to-end system that does not depend on language-specific pre/post-processing
