* A Multi-Agent System for Computer Science Education. [^Shi_2000]
	* A proposal for use of a multi-agent pedagogical systems to teach students computer science. The agent consists of personalized agents to teach a subject, assess students, and improve the curriculum.

* Self-Regulated Learning in Learning Environments With Pedagogical Agents That Interact in Natural Language.  [^Graesser_2010]
	* A survey of Self Regulated Learning in pedagogical agents.

* Lurch: A word processor that can grade students’ proofs. [^Carter_2013]
	* Introduces Lurch, a word processor that can assess whether statements in a document are mathematically sound. The paper focuses on the UX and the evaluation of the UX rather than the system itself. It is more geared towards education than being a powerful proof engine.

* Deep Natural Language Understanding and Automatic Feedback Generation for Intelligent Tutoring in Basic Electricity and Electronics. [^Dzikovska_2014]
	* Introduces Beetle II - a rule-based system that facilitates learning for a complex topic (electronics) by allowing students to experiment and by giving elaborative feedback via a symbolic NLP system coupled with domain knowledge.

* Robot Tutoring: On the Feasibility of Using Cognitive Systems as Tutors in Introductory Programming Education: A Teaching Experiment [^Muller_2018]
	* Cognitive systems like IBM Watson can only replace tutors (used to answer common questions) in a limited fashion, especially when they are deterministic, and unable to infer intent.

* Automated Scoring: Beyond Natural Language Processing [^Madnani_2018]
	* A position paper that argues the problem of Automated Scoring requires a multi-disciplinary view that focuses not only on the application and advancement of NLP techniques, but also a consideration on how stakeholders will deploy, use, and be affected by Automated Scoring technology.

* Zero Shot Learning for Code Education: Rubric Sampling with Deep Learning Inference [^Wu_2018]
	* Introduces Rubric Sampling. It generatively infers how likely a student response is given some misconceptions about the topic.

* Inferring Concept Prerequisite Relations from Online Educational Resources [^Roy_2019]
	* PREREQ Paper. It aims to infer pre-requisite relations between particular concepts based on data gathered from MOOCs.

* Generating Response-Specific Elaborated Feedback Using Long-Form Neural Question Answering [^Olney_2021]
	* Studies how to retrieve documents to provide elaborative feedback to students, and how to post-process this feedback.

* Towards Trustworthy AutoGrading of Short, Multi-lingual, Multi-type Answers [^Schneider_2023]
	* Fine tunes a transformer model using a more diverse short-form QA dataset for the purposes of AutoGrading. Notably ,it achieves more trust via more accuracy by allowing humans to manually grade difficult questions determined by a certain threshold of desired accuracy . It achieves better performance than other models, at the cost of higher variability .

* The Landscape of Teaching Resources for AI Education [^Druga_2022]
	* An analysis into the current state of resources for learning about AI. It finds that most existing resources are teacher-unfriendly (i.e., hard to use for teachers.)

* C3-IoC: A Career Guidance System for Assessing Student Skills using Machine Learning and Network Visualisation [^Garcia_2022]
	* Introduces C3-IoC, a career guidance system for IT which enables users to identify their hard and soft skills as well as where they land in the job landscape.

* Survey for Smart and Adaptative Education [^Bezerra_2022]
	* Conducts a survey on how Artificial Intelligence has been used to make a smarter and more adaptive education system. AI allows education systems to be more adaptive and interactive.
