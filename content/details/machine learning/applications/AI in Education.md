* Carter, N., & Monks, K. (2013, July). _Lurch: A word processor that can grade students’ proofs_.
	* Introduces Lurch, a word processor that can assess whether statements in a document are mathematically sound. The paper focuses on the UX and the evaluation of the UX rather than the system itself. It is more geared towards education than being a powerful proof engine.

	* Introduces Beetle II - a rule-based system that facilitates learning for a complex topic (electronics) by allowing students to experiment and by giving elaborative feedback via a symbolic NLP system coupled with domain knowledge.

	* Cognitive systems like IBM Watson can only replace tutors (used to answer common questions) in a limited fashion, especially when they are deterministic, and unable to infer intent.

	* A position paper that argues the problem of Automated Scoring requires a multi-disciplinary view that focuses not only on the application and advancement of NLP techniques, but also a consideration on how stakeholders will deploy, use, and be affected by Automated Scoring technology.

	* Introduces Rubric Sampling. It generatively infers how likely a student response is given some misconceptions about the topic.

	* PREREQ Paper. It aims to infer pre-requisite relations between particular concepts based on data gathered from MOOCs.

	* Studies how to retrieve documents to provide elaborative feedback to students, and how to post-process this feedback.

* Schneider, J., Richner, R., & Riser, M. (2023). Towards Trustworthy AutoGrading of Short, Multi-lingual, Multi-type Answers. _International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education_, _33_(1), 88–118. [https://doi.org/10.1007/s40593-022-00289-z](https://doi.org/10.1007/s40593-022-00289-z)
	* Fine tunes a transformer model using a more diverse short-form QA dataset for the purposes of AutoGrading. Notably ,it achieves more trust via more accuracy by allowing humans to manually grade difficult questions determined by a certain threshold of desired accuracy . It achieves better performance than other models, at the cost of higher variability .
