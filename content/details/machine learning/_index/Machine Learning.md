* The methods of Neural Style Transfer probably indicate that neural networks can extract the "essence" of an image in the same manner humans recognize an object even if it is rendered or perceived differently.
# Topics
* [[Low Level of Training a Model]]

# Tools
* [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co)- an open source platform provider of machine learning technologies. They also provide datasets.
* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) - a machine learning framework. *Opinon:* More developer friendly than TensorFlow
* [sentencepiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece)- a tokenizer that supports byte pair encoding. It allows ofr a purely end-to-end system that does not depend on language-specific pre/post-processing
* [tiktoken](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken)- a fast byte pair encoding tokenzier
