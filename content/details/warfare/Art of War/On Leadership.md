* Success is also motivated by the rulers just as much the capability and discipline of the subordinates
* Ultimately, someone has to lead and someone has to follow. The leader is responsible morally and strategically.
* *Be mindful of how subordinates are treated* [^3.13]
	* Be reasonable with your orders to your subordinates. Recognize that ideal situations almost never happen.
	* Exercise your authority. Give orders not requests. This saves time and leaves little room for question. 
	* Exercise proper strategy and tactics. Prefer to give direct orders than have a middle man for everything.
* *Introduce the appropriate hierarchies*. Learn to properly delegate tasks to subordinates but do so in a way that promotes synergy and communication [^5.1][^7.23]
	* *Communication across all parties is important to maintain order, especially for large groups*. A tight knit form of communication built from camaraderie is more desirable to avoid the enemy intercepting information.
	* *Have coordination*. Once all parts of the hierarchy act in harmony, the whole becomes better than the sum of its parts [^11.31].
* *Learn to use others synergistically*. It is better to rely on the collective energy of subordinates especially those suited for a task [^5.20][^5.21]. *Synergy is multiplicative*. 
	* *Cultivate resources. Be open to the indirect and ingenious approach* [^12.16]. Use the talents of everyone in the team and focus them on where they are most effective.
* Do not be ruled by emotions [^12.20][^13.2]. Do not do the following: [^7.12].
	* Be reckless. Rather, be rational and objective
	* Be a coward. Rather, be decisive in your actions
	* Be provoked by insults.  Rather, keep a cool head and do not let others exploit your emotions.
	* Be too concerned about honor. Rather, be willing to play dirty for the sake of winning.
	* Be too concerned for the well-being of subordinates. Rather, do not be afraid to utilize them.
* *The importance of a piece of knowledge is inversely proportional to the number of people who should know it in a timely manner* [^11.35]
