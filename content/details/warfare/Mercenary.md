* According to the Geneva Convention: A **mercenary** is someone who 
	* is recruited to fight in an armed conflict 
	* takes part in the hostilities 
	* is motivated by the desire for private gain or material compensation in excess of that which is offered to similar ranked soldiers from the army 
	* neither a national of a Party to the conflict nor a resident of territory controlled by the Party 
	* is not a member of the armed forces 
	* has not been sent to the conflict on official duty as a member of its armed forces.
	* *Mercenaries do not have the rights to be a combatant or prisoner of war.*
* The old mercenary bands have all but gone, replaced by what is now called private military contractor (PMC) or a private security company (PSC).
* PMCs employ a large selection of highly trained individuals with specialist skills, both military and non-military (i.e., engineers or doctors).
	* Civilians with no military background can still learn the necessary skills by joining the reserve forces. 

* *Becoming a mercenary requires knowledge on where to go* or rather where conflicts are, and which are especially dangerous enough to avoid unless offered a large sum.
* *See what skills are needed*. During the job interview, do not speak unless a question is asked. Do not ask about money or the contract until you are sure about what the job entails.
* *Mercenaries have to be fit*. They need speed and stamina. They must be able to travel while carrying heavy equipment. 
* *Food and caloric intake is less of a concern for a mercenary* since they will be performing strenuous tasks. They burn through twice as many calories as an average person.
* *Before thinking about the money, think about surviving long enough to spend it*.
