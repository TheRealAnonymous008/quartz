* According to the Geneva Convention: A **mercenary** is someone who 
	* is recruited to fight in an armed conflict 
	* takes part in the hostilities 
	* is motivated by the desire for private gain or material compensation in excess of that which is offered to similar ranked soldiers from the army 
	* neither a national of a Party to the conflict nor a resident of territory controlled by the Party 
	* is not a member of the armed forces 
	* has not been sent to the conflict on official duty as a member of its armed forces.
	* *Mercenaries do not have the rights to be a combatant or prisoner of war.*
* The old mercenary bands have all but gone, replaced by what is now called private military contractor (PMC) or a private security company (PSC).
* PMCs employ a large selection of highly trained individuals with specialist skills, both military and non-military (i.e., engineers or doctors).
	* Civilians with no military background can still learn the necessary skills by joining the reserve forces. 

* *Becoming a mercenary requires knowledge on where to go* or rather where conflicts are, and which are especially dangerous enough to avoid unless offered a large sum.
* *See what skills are needed*. During the job interview, do not speak unless a question is asked. Do not ask about money or the contract until you are sure about what the job entails.
* *Mercenaries have to be fit*. They need speed and stamina. They must be able to travel while carrying heavy equipment. 
* *Food and caloric intake is less of a concern for a mercenary* since they will be performing strenuous tasks. They burn through twice as many calories as an average person.
* *Before thinking about the money, think about surviving long enough to spend it. Know when to get out.*.
	* Make sure to have a plan to extract yourself in case of any emergency
	* Have a list of contacts (and backups of the list) ready.
	* Ensure you have good communication equipment
	* Alert your prime contact should you be about to undertake a dangerous task or journey, and give him or her a rough time as to when your task  should be complete.
	* Carry IDs with you (i.e. passports)
	* Give the enemy no starting place to identify you.
	* Bring money, both foreign and local currency 

* Mercenaries acquire their own weapons. They must also know how to operate their own weapons and foreign weapons.
	* Clothing is also necessary. Clothes must be kept clean, dry, and in proper condition. They must be well suited for the environment. 
	* Boots are essential for rough terrain and in emergency situations where the only option is to run away.
	* For body armor, decide on the necessary level of protection needed. Heavier protection often means heavier armor.  Also consider carrying capacity (i.e., those found in assault vests)
	* Consider good sleeping bags.
	* *Keep all equipment clean*

* Many soldiers of fortune have their own way of dealing with the daily routine. Some will act like robots and work, eat, and sleep day in and day out. Others will be euphoric: laughing and joking as they return safely back to base. What you will be experiencing is how each member of the team copes with the stress. They are not being insensitive and hard, they are just expressing their individual coping mechanism. Respect it.
	* *For mercenary teams, it is essential to learn to live with everyone else*

* War zones, for the most part, are ungoverned and lawless, and you are best treating everyone as hostile. *There is no law in war, other than the law of the gun*

* Do not become complacent. *The longer you stay and work in a war zone, the more you will become accustomed to everyday violence.* You will start to relax because of the “nothing has ever happened to me” syndrome. This is a dangerous state of mind, and one that will eventually get you killed
	* If you are in hostile territory, it would be wise to avoid all contact with the local population and to remain unseen
