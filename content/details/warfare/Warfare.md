* [As much as we would like to treat war as something that can be perfectly analyzed, war (and most important things) are clouded by human irrationality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7TQcQUfGUo)

* Clausewitz's definition of war is succinct -- War is the means of imposing our will on others.
* "War doesn't determine who's right, only those who are left* - Bertrand Russell

* In a war zone, life is very unpredictable, and despite taking all the caution possible and developing a safety net, there are times when bad luck simply takes over.
* The key elements of terrorism
	* It is premeditated 
	* It is political 
	* It is aimed at civilians
	* It is carried out by sub-national groups. 
* The sum of our national pride, religious belief, prosperity or poverty, and the political values of the family unit all form preconceptions in our mind towards those of other ethnic groups which may lead to acts of terror or war. 
* Insurrection is a byproduct of economic and sociopolitical circumstance

* **Lanchester's Laws** dictate the combat effectiveness of a military force without considering terrain or logistics
	* **Linear Law** - If one soldier can effectively fight one soldier at a time (on average), then the largest group will win. 
	* **Square Law** - If combat is all-against-all, that is soldiers can fight and be fought by multiple other soldiers, then the power of a force is proportional to the square of the number of units.
		* Intuitively this arises because one side can concentrate power  on a single unit, the single unit's power is equivalently diffused on the enemy units.
