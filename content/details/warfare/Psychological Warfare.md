# Interrogation Techniques
## General Approaches
* **Reid Technique** - a three phase process starting with fact analysis and behavior analysis. The goal is to make the source be more confident in telling the truth. The interrogation consists of he following steps: 
	* *Positive Confrontation* - Tell the source that there is evidence to suggest they are suspect and offer them a chance to explain themselves 
	* *Develop themes* - The themes, established through monologue, establish reasons that the crime could have been committed. Find the theme the source is most receptive to 
	* *Minimize denials* - Denials only boost the source's psychological morale. 
	* *Move towards Acknowledgement* - if the source gives a reason they could not have committed the crime, move towards acknowledgment of what they did. 
	* *Reinforce sincerity*
	* *Move towards alternatives*. The investigator should be receptive of signs of guilt (such as crying) 
	* *Pose the alternate question* - pose a false dilemma between two alternatives, but both lead to an admission of guilt.  There is a third (hidden) option for the source which is to deny
	* *Lead the suspect to repeat the admission of guilt* 
	* *Obtain a confession*

## Strategies
* **Futility Technique** - make the source believe that it is useless to resist and to persuade him to cooperate with the investigator. 
	* It plays with the doubts that already exist in the source's mind 
* **We Know All Approach**  - convinces the source that the interrogators already know everything.
	* During the source's narrative, the interrogator interjects and asks questions for which they do not have answers for.
* **File and Dossier** - the investigator prepares a dossier containing all available information. 
	* The dossier is arranged to make it appear to have more data than it has. 
	* The source can be intimidated by reading known data. 
	* It plays with the source's naivete and the ability of the investigator to convince the source 
* **Decreased Fear Down** - calm the source and convince the source they will be properly treated.
	* It creates rapport easily using kindness.
* **Good Cop Bad Cop** - involves two investigators playing actors. The bad cop is unsympathetic to the source, while the good cop is sympathetic. 
	* The good cop aims to build rapport. 
* **How and Why Solution** - the interrogation is divided into two. In phase one, the investigator builds rapport by establishing themes as to why the crime was committed. In phase two, the investigator induces fatigue and fear before confrontation. 

## Tactics 
* **Leading Questions** - a question that suggests a particular answer from the source.
