* *Warning*: Do not try any of this without proper training. Recognize that they can kill or injure a person. [[On Preparation and Planning|The first step is to know yourself]], [[Minimal Effort, Maximal Impact| and then to pick your fights carefully]]. 
* *All martial arts depend on speed and balance. Without body balance, there is no strength. Speed will give you first contact*. 


* If someone challenges you, stand in an alert position, listen to what your opponent is saying, look him or her straight in the eye, and hold the contact.
* *Your defense is all about reality. What can you realistically do in the situation?* 
* When no guns or weapons are used, the aim of any self-defense is to enable you to extract yourself or others while using the minimum amount of force necessary.


* When under fire, rounds that come close make a zipping noise, while sounds that are very close will crack.
* When taking fire, resist the urge to return fire unless you have a definitive target. Never waste ammo.

* You do not need strength to deliver a good punch. It is a matter of maneuverability, speed, and timing. 
	* *Balled fist*. The first punch hits a vital target. The effect can be increased by adding more weight to the fist. 
	* *Open palm*. Aim for the ears to rupture their eardrums. Use a chopping motion or a slap 
	* *Heel of the Hand*. Aim for a chin jab. When attacking the face go for the eyes. You are less likely to injure your hand this way. 
	* *Edge of the Hand* use a pinkie strike. Arm is never straight and use a chopping action 
	* *Elbow* - good when you are on the side or have your back to the assailant. 
	* *Knee* - limited mobility but high power and can damage the lower parts effectively. 
	* *Foot* - as good as a punch but can make you unbalanced. Kick sideways to maximize force 
	* *Teeth* - bite on exposed parts.
