* Stay professional, stay alert and do your job to the best of your ability. 

## Risk Assessment 
* *Risk management is the very reason why PMCs started and why they continue to grow*

* *All warzones are high-risk areas*. It is critical to know which areas are safe and which should be avoided. 
* *Know about insurance*. For contract work, read the fine print. 
* *Know the [[The Art of War|local area]] if possible*. 
	* For contract work, know what the contractor is willing to provide in terms of equipment. 
	* Communicate with other local allied forces. 
* *Know the enemy*. How do they operate? What risk do they represent? 

* The main components of risk assessment are 
	* Physical Security 
	* Vulnerability Analysis 
	* Security Effectiveness 
	* Consequence (what if )
	* Likelihood of attack
* In risk assessment, gauge the probability of an undesired event taking place and the severity of such an attack. 
* Understanding the problem and providing simple effective solutions is what makes a good risk assessment

* **Dynamic Threat Assessment** - assessment done in a dynamic environment where everything changes and risk assessments must be done quickly 
	* Take note of the people in the immediate environment. 
	* Take note of potentially dangerous objects 
	* Check the environment 
	* Once the primary risks are addressed, look out for more mundane threats. 

## Combat 
* **Double Tap** - fire two shots in rapid succession. 
* *Speed and Aggression play a major role in any successful assault or defense* 
	* Quickly close in on the enemy in their moment of hesitation. 
	* React instantly with no hesitation 
* Know how to operate your weapons, what causes any malfunction, and how to resolve these malfunctions quickly 
	* Know how to operate the enemy's weapons as well. 
* [[Martial Arts]] apply for CQB
	* *Deliver a single devastating blow*. In a confrontation, aim to incapacitate or kill.  
	* *The secret is recognizing the precise moment when you should strike that one blow and make it swift, sharp, and accurate*
* Know how to act in various scenarios 
	* *Hostage Rescue (or abduction)*
	* *Aircraft Assault* (i.e., hijacking or counter hijacking)
		* Realistically involves waiting for the aircraft to be grounded. The aircraft is then surrounded and isolated. 
		* Will require knowledge of the layout, as well as a distraction plan (for counter-hijacking)
	* *Ship Assault*. Generally treated the same as a building assault, but with the threat of sinking the ship 
	* *Road Assault*.  Involves an assault on something that can move forward (on a road or rail) and may need to be stopped. 

## Bodyguarding and Personnel Protection 
* The level of protection is proportional to the levels of: the Principal's importance, the threat they face, and the magnitude of that threat. 
	* **Full CP teams** may provide protection to a Principal throughout a twenty-four hour period. 
		* **Personal Escort Squad** - made up of the more experienced members of the security team. The first line of defense and extra alert for any threat. 
		* **Security Advance Party** - makes recon of the route in advance. They look for signs of an ambush, threats or hostile surveillance 
		* **Residence Security Team** - responsible for the Principal's security when they are within a building. They evaluate the building's security systems. 
	* **Discreet Protection** provided using two-man teams with the aim of not standing out. 
	* **One man**, typically very experienced accompanies the Principal. 
* *Even with a full security detail, protection services can still fail.*
* Sometimes the Principal may be the problem (due to ego or ignoring advice). In bodyguarding services, one must be able to adapt to the whims of the Principal.
	* *It is patterns that get VIPs killed*.
	* It is imperative to know the Principal. Sometimes the Principal [[Design of Everyday Things|doesn't know what they want]].  Consider the  7P's 
		* *People* that surround the client 
		* *[[Personality]]* of the client
		* *[[Human Biases|Prejudices]]* against a particular group. 
		* *Places* the Principal will be going to. 
		* *Personal History* including medical history and previous employments
		* *Political and Religious Persuasions*
		* *Private Life* away from employment. 
* Some tips (from [[How to Become a Mercenary -- the Ultimate Guide to the Weapons, Training and Tactics of the Modern Warrior for Hire by Barry Davies|Davies]])
	* **230 Rule** - a car travelling lest than 35 mph should not be opened more than 2 inches.
	* Bodyguard should ideally be at the drivers seat with the Principal at the rear. 
	* Disable the airbags if the bodyguard is at the driver seat 
	* Bodyguard should never wear a seatbelt.  
	* The maximum number of vehicles should not exceed three. In the case of a convoy, each vehicle must be aware of the other vehicles in support. The lead driver should account for how the support vehicle is driving.
	* Stay alert
	* *Understand the situation, and you will understand what protection is required.*
	* Take responsibility for your own safety, and make sure that everyone you are operating with does the same
	* Know the likely threats that you will encounter, and plan contingency measures in case they happen, including escape routes. Make sure everyone is aware of these threats
	* *If you are aware that violence can take place anywhere and at any time, then your chances of avoiding it are greatly increased.* Being aware of danger adds to confidence
* **High Profile Protection** - rarely used in a war zone because it pinpoints the Principal as a target. In an urban setting, however, the high profile acts as a deterrent. 
* **Low Profile Protection** - requires more skill than high profile protection. The bodyguards are discreet yet still provide protection to the Principal. 
* During an attack, the aim is to evacuate the Principal and neutralize the threat if possible. For long range attacks, keep the Principal low 

## Training 
* Soldiers and [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] may be contracted to train other soldiers and police force. 
* One important skill set is [[Polymathy and Learning|teaching]] counter-terrorism. 
* Know who you are training (to know their current skill set) and where (to know what facilities are available).
* Soldiers that train others need an in-depth understanding of the subject they are teaching. 

## Kidnapping Measures 
* Most kidnappings in war are opportune rather than premeditated.
* Once taken captive, most kidnapped people tend to be taken and held in rural areas away from cities
* Consider the following measures when kidnapped 
	* Avoid capture at all costs, do whatever it takes to stay free, but do not risk running from armed men in close proximity
	* Be aware of what is happening around you. If possible, check the time and date. Try to estimate the journey time and the direction they are taking you.
	* During the initial capture, the kidnappers will be very excited. 
	* Do not talk back. [[The 48 Laws of Power#19. Know Who You're Dealing With -- Do Not Offend The Wrong Person|Do not stand out]]. 
	* Do not antagonize your captors or agitate them. Do not look them in the eyes.
	* Do not ask question. Let them ask questions. 
	* Do not sign anything if possible 
	* Be aware of self-induced pressures -- lack of sleep, fear, or loneliness. 
	* When questioned, do not show emotion. Try to be strong or appear frightened and confused. 
	* Be polite and thank them if they offer food or water
	* When isolated and alone, make yourself as comfortable as possible. 
	* When you hear someone approaching, remain calm but mentally alert.
	* If you hear rescue coming, work towards a safe position -- on the floor away from entryways and make it apparent you are a hostage. 

## Security 
* *Key Control* - make sure someone handles the keys. Have a spare key but 
	* Hide the spare key 
	* Never tag the keys 
	* Change the locks if you lose the keys 
	* Check all windows and doors. 
* *Alarm Systems* - prefer more silent alarms to not tip off the intruder.  Prefer alarms that are simple but flexible 
* *Deliveries* - handle deliveries properly 
	* Make a clear list of expected deliveries -- who and at what time 
	* Be suspicious of unexpected packets or thick envelopes 
	* Check packages that are heavier than normal 
	* Check packages that smell like cyanide 
	* Check if there's grease from the package 
	* Do not open any suspicious packages 
	* For suspicious packages leave it undisturbed, vacate the room and inform the disposal team (bomb or chemical)
* *Fires* 
	* Fit the place with smoke detectors. 
	* Remember even mundane things can be fire risks. Keep the smoke detectors active at all times 
	* Have a fire extinguisher handy. Use the correct fire extinguisher and be familiar with it 
	* Have fire drills. 
		* Make an escape plan and practice it
		* Indicate where fire extinguishers are located 
		* Give individuals specific tasks 
		* Have an assembly point in a safe area outside then check off everyone 
		* Do not, under any circumstance, allow anyone back into a building that is on fire.
	* Check for fire hazards wherever they might exist.
		* No overloaded electrical sockets 
		* No clothes over heaters 
		* Switch off and unplug electrical appliances before exiting or at night 
		* Extinguish burning candles 
		* No aerosol containers on on top of hot surfaces 
		* Do not leave smoking cigarettes 
		* Do not smoke in bed or drunk 
* *Surveillance*
	* Consider the methods outlined [[Social Engineering|here]].
	* Look for capability and intent 
	* Some more examples of surveillance equipment 
		* Video cameras 
		* Infrared 
		* Thermal imaging devices 
		* Night vision devices. 
		* Wiretapping devices
		* UAVs and unmanned drones
		* Discrete cameras (i.e., those placed in pens)
		* Satellites
