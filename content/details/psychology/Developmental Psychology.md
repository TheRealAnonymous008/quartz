* **Developmental psychology** is concerned with understanding both what changes occur with age, and how those changes take place—the process of development. It is concerned with two main questions. 
	* Does development take place in stages or is the process more continuous, or more variable, than that? 
	* Is Development [[Biology|biologically]] determined by nature or nurture

* Similarities in the characteristics of genetically identical twins reared apart suggest strong genetic influences on development. However, it is clear that the environment also influences development
* *Babies are predisposed to learn*
	* Children as young as 15 months can have some understanding of false beliefs.
	* Even 6 month old babies can use this strategically
	* Babies as young as 10 months have some understanding of social dominance.
	* The child's bond with their primary caregiver (called **attachment**) is a determinant for psychological development.*Secure attachments enable children to feel secure in exploring new settings and becoming detached*.  
		* Securely attached children are able to use their caregiver's presence as a safe base for exploration and protest at their departure
		* Children with a more avoidant attachment pattern treat strangers and caregivers similarly.
		* Ambivalent or resistant attachment patterns mean the child has difficulty in using the caregiver as a safe base for exploration and showing distress on separation but anger on return. 
	* In humans, it seems that the most important factors influencing attachment are the child’s temperament (its ‘nature’) and the attachment figure’s responsiveness: understanding of and sensitivity to the child’s need

* The harmful effects of early experiences can be ameliorated if the child is rehabilitated and conditions improved

* One of the last regions to become fully formed is the region that inhibits risky behavior. 
	* As we mature, the amount of myelin increases which improves neural function.
	* *Intelligence appears to increase for those who continue to use their minds*

# Erikson's Theory 
* **Erikson's Theory Of Development** suggests that developments occurs in stages with each stage involving a specific dilemma or **psychosocial crisis**. These stages need not be fixed.
