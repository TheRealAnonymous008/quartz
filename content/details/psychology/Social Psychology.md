* A **Mirror Neuron System** might be responsible for understanding the behavior of others -- these  neurons fire both when the animals acts and when another animal acts.  This allows for imitation and empathy.
* **Social Facilitation** refers to the impact of human behavior on the presence of others. 
* Social behavior is influenced by the constant automatic reaction to and interpretation of our environment
# Leadership
* **Leadership** pertains to when someone tries to influence the group as a whole.  *Leadership is primarily determined by the functions the group needs a leader to fulfill.* 
* A participative style, which attempts to involve all in decision-making, promotes high productivity with good relationships between group members. 
* A more authoritarian, directive style allows group members less say in decisions and produces equal productivity (provided the leader is present), but tends to lead to poorer relationships and less cooperation. 
* Laissez-faire leadership, which leaves the group to its own devices, results in lower productivity.

# Conformity 
* **Conformity** is the act of matching attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to perceived group norms. 
* The dissent of even one person reduces conformity in a group.

* **Compliance** refers to a form of conformity wherein one goes along with the majority opinion even if they do not personally agree.
* **Internalization** involves taking on board the opinion of another or of a group. This is strongest when the source is perceived to be an expert. 

# Obedience
* **Obedience** refers to complying with the demands of an authority figure 
* Ordinary people will go very far indeed when they are instructed to do so by someone perceived to be in a position of authority.
	* People are more prepared to inflict pain if they can distance themselves from the victim.
	* Believing the violence to be a means to an end in a worthy cause (i.e., any form of ideological justification), increases obedience.

# Prejudice
* Dividing people into ethnic groups, and [[False Priors|stereotyping]] behavior according to group membership may have had evolutionary advantage
* Prejudice is a global phenomenon and clearly situational influences contribute to its development
	* [[Personality]] characteristics, such as being less flexible and more authoritarian, are associated with prejudice
	* Prejudice can also arise from a general need to see oneself positively
	* Prejudice can also be a form of scapegoating, in which aggression is directed towards an innocent third party 

* **Group Conflict Theory** offers an explanation for negative attitudes towards racial integration and efforts to promote diversityâ€”the majority group perceives the minority group(s) to be in competition with the majority group

* The absence of direct contact with another group leads to **autistic hostility** (ignorance of others) which produces a failure to understand the reasons for their actions and provides no opportunities to find out if negative interpretations of their behavior are incorrect. 
	* Contact between opposing groups is needed before prejudices can be reduced, provided the contact does not reinforce stereotypes or inequities 

# Miscellaneous
* **Coaction Effect** - when people are asked not to compete, they work faster when they can see others working. 
* **Audience Effect** - people work faster when they are being observed by others. 

* [The Werther Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copycat_suicide) - a spike in copycat suicides after a widely publicized suicide. The copycats have similar demographics to the publicized person, and so more of these tend to get reported. 
	* It is effectively an [[Information Hazards]].
	* A manifestation of this -- there is a correlation between when a suicide's publication and the number of fatal accidents (i.e., the drivers were copycats)
