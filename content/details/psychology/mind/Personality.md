* **Personality** reflects a characteristic set of behaviors, attitudes, interests, motives, and feelings about the world.

# Theories
* **Categorical Type** - people are fitted into broad categories, with each type being qualitatively different from others.
* **Trait** - people are defined according to how much of each of a list of traits they have
* **Behaviorist** - personality is a reflection of the person's learning history -- people repeat responses reinforced in the past. 
* **Cognitive** - beliefs, thoughts and mental processes are seen as primary determinants for  behavior across situations.
* **Psychodynamic** - personality is determined by intrapsychic structures (Freud's id, ego, and superego) and by unconscious motives or conflicts from early childhood.
* **Individual** - emphasizes higher human motives and views personality as the individual's complete experience rather than having separate parts.
* **Situational** - personality is not consistent. It is merely a response to a situation learnt through reinforcement
* **Interactive** - Combines the situational and trait approaches -- people have a tendency to behave in certain ways but that is moderated by the demands of different situations.


* *Both situational and individual factors contribute to enduring characteristics attributed to personality* 
* The discovery of neural correlates of personality suggests it has a biological basis, and that individual differences in personality are related to meaningful individual *differences in brain structures and responses to social stimuli.*
