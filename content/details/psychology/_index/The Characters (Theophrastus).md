* Loquacity is an incontinence of the tongue. 
* He seizes on every opportunity of talking so that one who would confer with him knows not when to take breath.
* A man of this sort puts a stop alike to business and to pleasure. He will frankly confess that it is hard for a talker to hold his peace.

### XVI. The Morose

* He is altogether an unapproachable, and most unsavory personage. His manners are like his appearance.

### XXI. The Disagreeable
* It is perhaps easier to bear with a neighbor, from whom we occasionally receive some serious injury, than with a constant companion whose conversation is tedious, and whose manners are unpleasing.

### XXII. The Vain
* When ambition is the ruling passion of a vulgar mind, it shows itself in the eager pursuit of frivolous distinctions.

### XXX. The Malignant
* Some men love and pursue evil, purely for its own sake, with an eager relish. A man of this temper seeks his element amid the turbulences of public life. 
* He thinks to become at once thoroughly practiced in mischief. The good he defames and persecutes, the bad alone he applauds. 
* "So goes the world, there is no such thing as an honest man; that all are knaves alike."
