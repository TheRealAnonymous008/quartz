* **Berkson's Paradox** - the tendency to misinterpret statistical experiments involving conditional probabilities, not taking into account likelihoods and the subpopulation sampled.

* **Sunk Cost Fallacy** - the greater tendency to continue an endeavor once a commitment has been made even with contradictory evidence.
	* It is a fallacy because we factor in past costs rather than present and future costs.
	* Whether or not the endeavor succeeds doesn't suddenly refund one's commitment to it. The sunk cost is not recovered once paid for.
	* It can be attributed to a mix of commitment bias, and loss aversion.

* **G.I. Joe Fallacy** - the tendency to think that knowing a fallacy or bias is enough to counteract its influence.

* **Gambler's Fallacy** - the tendency to think that independent events influence each other even when they do not. If an event did not happen in the past, it will happen in the future.
	* It arises from *misattributing two events as causally link when they are in fact independent*
	* The above, in turn, arises from how we *try to make sense of random events by seeing patterns*
	* Another reason is due to *observing only a small sample size* and us not realizing that the past in this case is not representative of the future.
	* It is also due to a *misconception that chance is fair, rather than random*.

* **Hot Hand Fallacy** - the belief that a win streak implies more success into the future.
	* It happens when we make assumptions or decisions based on a small sample of observations.
	* Thus it *arises from our tendency to find patterns and trends, without taking into account random chance.*

* **Subadditivity Effect** - the tendency to judge probability of the whole to be less than the probabilities of the parts.

* **Time-saving bias** - the tendency to misestimate the time that could be saved or lost when increasing or decreasing speed.

* **Zero Sum Bias** - a situation is incorrectly perceived as a zero-sum game.
