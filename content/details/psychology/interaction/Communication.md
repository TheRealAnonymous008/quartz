 * *The challenge is to switch our communication profile on the fly to make communication with others easier*. It is easy to fall back into a communication style that we are comfortable with 

* *The approach is important*. It is those first crucial seconds of interaction between you and a stranger that will set the tone for the rest of the engagement
	* *Ask the following during the approach*: What do you think a person you are about to communicate with needs from you so they can feel comfortable and safe?
		* Who are you? 
		* What do you want? 
		* Are you a threat? 
		* How long will this take?

* *To be a good influencer, you must think more about what the other person wants when communicating and less about how you prefer to communicate.*
