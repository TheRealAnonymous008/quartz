 * *The challenge is to switch our communication profile on the fly to make communication with others easier*. It is easy to fall back into a communication style that we are comfortable with 

* *The approach is important*. It is those first crucial seconds of interaction between you and a stranger that will set the tone for the rest of the engagement
	* *Ask the following during the approach*: What do you think a person you are about to communicate with needs from you so they can feel comfortable and safe?
		* Who are you? 
		* What do you want? 
		* Are you a threat? 
		* How long will this take?

* *To be a good influencer, you must think more about what the other person wants when communicating and less about how you prefer to communicate.*

# Building Rapport
* **Tribe Mentality** is prevalent as a human phenomenon and c.an be exploited when building rapport.  *Mirror certain aspects of a group to become part of the tribe*.  Exploit [[False Priors and Extension Neglect|Stereotypes]].

* *To build rapport is to build a bridge for communication based on trust and common interests*. The goal is to make the other party better for having met you. 
* *Building enough rapport can lead to not having to apply social engineering principles to gain compliance; the target trusts and divulges information on their own.* This is also a good indicator if sufficient rapport has been built. 
* At the initial approach to the target, remember that your level of rapport will be zero.

## Hadnagy and Robin's Principles of Rapport 
* *Use Artificial Time Constraints*. Consider how long the engagement will take 
	* If the time constraint is too quick or too artificial, it does not hold the weight it needs to
	* The time constraint must also be realistic for the pretext you chose to use.

* *Accommodating Nonverbals*. Your nonverbal body language needs to match the pretext you are using. 
	* When nonverbal body language matches what is being said, the target can answer whether or not you are a threat.
	* The main obstacle is your own tension and nervousness. that gets in the way of controlling your emotions and nonverbal cues.
	* Understand clearly what would be normal for the pretext you are choosing and then have that in mind before you launch.

* *Using a slower rate of speech* 
	* Speak too fast and your risk stuttering or stumbling over your words which does not build confidence
	* Speak too slow and you risk sounding condescending or ignorant.
	* Consider *RSVP - Rhythm, Speed, Volume, and Pitch*. Try to math the other person's RSVP.
	* Use local lingo and slang. 
	* Match your RSVP with your pretext.

* *Employing Sympathy or Assistance Themes*. If the sympathy or assistance request is handled properly, the person being asked will have a strong emotional connection to that request
	* The level of the assistance you request must be equal to the level of rapport you have built.
	* If someone with whom you have no rapport requests assistance thatâ€™s too personal or too great, it has the reverse effect of building rapport and can make you suspicious.

* *[[The 48 Laws of Power|Suspend your ego]]*. Set aside your ego for the other person. Make the other person feel strong. 
	* Let the target inflate their ego. 
	* Have some knowledge on the topic; Pretend to have limited knowledge; Ask good questions.

* *Validating Others*. Agree with, Complement or Endorse someone else's statements, decisions or choices, even if you may not genuinely agree. 
	* The level of validation must be equal to the level of rapport 
	* Allowing the other's ego to inflate also makes them feel validated. 

* *Ask How, Why, and When Questions*. Open ended questions are good for keeping a conversation going. Ask for their opinion 
	* When employing open ended questions, listen to the  response. Make sure to appear interested otherwise this kills rapport.
	* Practice active listening. 

* *Quid Pro Quo*. Make sure that what you give them in the conversation feels equal to what they gave you. 
	* The information you give doesn't have to be real but remember that the more fake details you give, the more you must remember. Hence, [[Software Engineering|Keep it simple, stupid]]. 

* *Employ reciprocal altruism*. Send out altruism by giving something important to the target and in return the target gives something to you. 
	* If you give something of value to a person, he or she will feel indebted and want to repay that gift
	* Remember that the receiver of the gift determines its value. Don't assume that because you value it, the target will as well. 

* *Manage expectations* Do not use these techniques all the time. Try not to get overwhelmed by the number of information you receive.
	* Going too far may damage rapport permanently. 
	* *Leave them feeling better for having met you.* If things are not going well, back off and move on.

* *Learn to disengage*. When you need to exit the conversation, have a few strategies in mind. These strategies can employ the other techniques to have a more graceful exit.
