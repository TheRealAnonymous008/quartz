# Building Rapport
* **Tribe Mentality** is prevalent as a human phenomenon and c.an be exploited when building rapport.  *Mirror certain aspects of a group to become part of the tribe*.  Exploit [[False Priors and Extension Neglect|Stereotypes]].

* *To build rapport is to build a bridge for communication based on trust and common interests*. The goal is to make the other party better for having met you. 
* *Building enough rapport can lead to not having to apply social engineering principles to gain compliance; the target trusts and divulges information on their own.* This is also a good indicator if sufficient rapport has been built. 
* At the initial approach to the target, remember that your level of rapport will be zero.

## Hadnagy and Robin's Principles of Rapport 
* *Use Artificial Time Constraints*. Consider how long the engagement will take 
	* If the time constraint is too quick or too artificial, it does not hold the weight it needs to
	* The time constraint must also be realistic for the pretext you chose to use.

* *Accommodating Nonverbals*. Your nonverbal body language needs to match the pretext you are using. 
	* When nonverbal body language matches what is being said, the target can answer whether or not you are a threat.
	* The main obstacle is your own tension and nervousness. that gets in the way of controlling your emotions and nonverbal cues.
	* Understand clearly what would be normal for the pretext you are choosing and then have that in mind before you launch.

* *Using a slower rate of speech* 
	* Speak too fast and your risk stuttering or stumbling over your words which does not build confidence
	* Speak too slow and you risk sounding condescending or ignorant.
	* Consider *RSVP - Rhythm, Speed, Volume, and Pitch*. Try to math the other person's RSVP.
	* Use local lingo and slang. 
	* Match your RSVP with your pretext.

* *Employing Sympathy or Assistance Themes*. If the sympathy or assistance request is handled properly, the person being asked will have a strong emotional connection to that request
	* The level of the assistance you request must be equal to the level of rapport you have built.
	* If someone with whom you have no rapport requests assistance thatâ€™s too personal or too great, it has the reverse effect of building rapport and can make you suspicious.

* *[[The 48 Laws of Power|Suspend your ego]]*. Set aside your ego for the other person. Make the other person feel strong. 
	* Let the target inflate their ego. 
	* Have some knowledge on the topic; Pretend to have limited knowledge; Ask good questions.

* *Validating Others*. Agree with, Complement or Endorse someone else's statements, decisions or choices, even if you may not genuinely agree. 
	* The level of validation must be equal to the level of rapport 
	* Allowing the other's ego to inflate also makes them feel validated. 

* *Ask How, Why, and When Questions*. Open ended questions are good for keeping a conversation going. Ask for their opinion 
	* When employing open ended questions, listen to the  response. Make sure to appear interested otherwise this kills rapport.
	* Practice active listening. 

* *Quid Pro Quo*. Make sure that what you give them in the conversation feels equal to what they gave you. 
	* The information you give doesn't have to be real but remember that the more fake details you give, the more you must remember. Hence, [[Software Engineering|Keep it simple, stupid]]. 

* *Employ reciprocal altruism*. Send out altruism by giving something important to the target and in return the target gives something to you. 
	* If you give something of value to a person, he or she will feel indebted and want to repay that gift
	* Remember that the receiver of the gift determines its value. Don't assume that because you value it, the target will as well. 

* *Manage expectations* Do not use these techniques all the time. Try not to get overwhelmed by the number of information you receive.
	* Going too far may damage rapport permanently. 
	* *Leave them feeling better for having met you.* If things are not going well, back off and move on.

* *Learn to disengage*. When you need to exit the conversation, have a few strategies in mind. These strategies can employ the other techniques to have a more graceful exit. 

# Conversation
* **Framing** -- how someone views or reacts to certain situations, is largely based on an accumulation of personal experience. *[[Framing Effect|Framing]] is a dynamic thing*.
* The goal of proper communication should be to *bridge between you and your interlocutor's frame*. 

 * Consider *Lakoff's Rule for Framing* 
	 * *Everything you say evokes the frame.*
		 * Think of how details matter in creating [[Narrative]].  
		 * Think about your vocabulary and ask if the word choices evoke any emotion (positive or negative). Be cautious when it is evokes potentially negative emotions
	* *Words that are defined with the frame, evoke the frame*
		* You can describe a thing without having to name the thing itself, a variant of [[General Story Writing Principles|Show don't tell]]. 
	* *Negating the frame should be avoided*. 
		* If you do not want your interlocutor to think about it, don't [[Psychology|mention it]]; don't make them think about it. 
		* Negating the frame entails mentioning the frame of the opposition.
	* *Causing the target to thinking about the frame reinforces the frame*.

* **Elicitation**  - getting information that you never asked for. It is steering the conversation in a certain way to obtain information. 
	* If done right, *elicitation should look and feel like a normal, non-forced conversation with your target.*
	* *Appeal to the target's ego*
		* Be sincere 
		* Have the appropriate level of rapport 
		* Be realistic. 
		* Be mindful of how others act. 
	* *Establish mutual interest and set aside controversial disagreements. *
		* Look for a middle ground between two opposing camps. 
		* Avoid controversial topics
	* *Use deliberate false statements.*
		* This exploits the human instinct to correct people for their mistakes. 
		* Using deliberate false statement too many times in a row can make you come across as unknowledgeable, and that can make your target lose faith in you.
		* This works much better if you establish more rapport 
		* The false statement must have some truth to it. Do not confuse the target.
	* *Have Knowledge but Don't be a know-it-all*. Knowledge makes you more believable. 
	* *Use questions*. 
		* Exploit the human reflex to formulate responses to questions. 
		* Questions can keep the conversation more interesting
		* *Open ended questions* don't direct the receiver to any particular direction, but allows them to answer from their opinion.
			* They allow the target control of how much to give. 
			* They can help build rapport and validate the target's ego.
			* Using this requires employing active listening. 
		* *Closed-ended questions* elicit brief and narrow answers. 
			* They are used to verify facts already known. 
			* They are used to read nonverbals. 
			* They allow securing explicit bits of information. 
		* *Leading questions* lead the brain to focus on one thing and ignore everything else. 
		* *Assumptive questions* are when you have some knowledge and can make an assumption to confirm that knowledge with a question or statement. They can be used to bypass conversation stoppers. 

# Nonverbal Communication 
* We can use pretexts to elicit the emotions we want with the person we are communicating with. 
* The key is to have a grasp on the emotions that we display to others, and conversely to react to the emotions displayed by others. 
* Emotional reactions cause nonverbal responses as seen in nonverbal cues. 
* If you create an emotion, or you cause the target to express that emotion, you can leave the target feeling that emotion.

* A **baseline** is the emotional content you see being displayed at the moment you start observing.
	* *The baseline is not the person's personality, it is focused on the emotional content displayed at the moment.*
	* It is not the mere presence or absence of behaviors, such as gaze aversion or fidgeting, that indicates lying. Rather, *it is how these nonverbal cues change over time from a person's baseline* and how they combine with the individual's words. And, when just the behavioral cues from these sources are considered, they accurately differentiate between lying and truth telling.
	* Approach each situation without using preconceived judgments, even if you're approaching a target you've interacted with before

* *Consider some rules for body language*
	* *Focus on the What -- not the Why*. Don't make connections between the what and why without having all the information.
	* *Examine the Clusters*. Do not focus on one cue, use context and other cues to derive the subtext. 
	* *Look for congruence* specifically between verbal and nonverbal communication.
	* *Pay attention to the Context*. Without context, you may misread the nonverbal cues. Ask how people usually act in a particular context. 

## Emotional Responses 
* *Anger* 
	* Tense, tight, ready to fight. 
	* Attempting to make themselves larger.
	* Eyes are wide open with the brows furrowed. 
	* Glaring eyes 
* *Disgust*
	* The person is attempting to turn away from the thing causing disgust 
	* Repulsed or lack of interest 
* *Contempt*
	* A sense of moral superiority. 
	* Puffing up and appearing bigger. or aggressive.

* *Surprise*
	* Eyes are wide open 
	* Body tenses 
	* The mouth opens in an "Ohh" shape as if catching one's breath in shock.
	* Alternatively, the person may cover their mouth 
	* Head leaning back with raised expressions. 
* *Sadness* 
	* Corners of the mouth turning down 
	* Eyelids drooping 
	* Eyebrows coming together and going  up.
	* The person becomes smaller / the opposite of confident
	* The person seeks comfort (i.e., holding themselves). 
	* Blocking of the eyes, as if to hide tears. 
* *Happiness*
