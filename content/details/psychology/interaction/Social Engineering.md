* Social engineering takes the way humans are wired to make decisions and exploits the vulnerabilities in those processes. 
* The goal is to have someone make a decision without [[Thinking Fast And Slow|thinking]] and to act in a way that is not in their best interests.  
	* *Thinking is the enemy of the social engineer*. 
	* Heightened emotional reactions and intimate moments that cause the subject's brain to release dopamine and oxytocin help. 

# The SE Pyramid 
## Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)
* **OSINT** is the life blood of social engineering pertaining to *relevant information about the target*. 
* The key is to combine both nontechnical and technical OSINT to uncover information about the target. 
* *It is recommended to document findings to keep everything organized*.

* *Caveat: Remember that just because you can see "what" doesn't mean you can automatically know "why"*. The connection between the two can only be established through further observation and more information.

### Non-Technical OSINT 
* This is anything that does not involve direct interaction with a computer. This is usually where social engineering starts. 
* *The vast majority of non-technical OSINT skills constitutes **observational skills***. Observe the environment, Gather Information and use this information as the situation arises. 
* Observing allows us to both spot opportunities (vulnerabilities) in the environment, and to gather seemingly trivial information that can give us access to more secure information 
* *Be detail-oriented and observe everything*. Not only can this make for a good cover in the context of OSINT gathering, but if the target can catch onto missing or suspicious details, then your cover will be blown.  *The little details (especially that which the target can catch) matter*

* *Practice*: Remember details of the people around you. Begin with simple details and scale up in complexity to formulating a crude profile of the person(s) 

### Technical OSINT 
* Information can come from a variety of sources
	* Social media - a profile of the target can be built just from this.
		* *Caveat: Online personalities != Real personality. What is online is how a person wants to be viewed online*
	* Search engines - the Internet holds secrets for those who know how to ask
		* *Information about the target's family* is good as well. They offer good attack vectors. 
		* Especially look at indexed and cached web pages .
		* Use search operators to minimize search 
		* Look at images of the target if possible 
	* RSA Keys - we can search using the query 
	```
	BEGIN (CERTIFICATE|DSA|RSA) filetype:key
	```
	* Webcam information 
	* Misconfigured directories and robot.txt files can give additional information -- look at what files in the robot.txt are "disallowed". 
	* Metadata - both text and from EXIF data in images. 

## Pretext Development
* **Pretext Development** - develop a pretext based on OSINT. The pretext means that you *become anyone you want to be; presenting yourself as someone else to obtain information*.   
* The point is that there is no such thing as one pretext that fits all situations
* Method acting and Improv helps in this regard.

* Keep in mind the following principles
	* *Think through your goals*.. Use the results from OSINT to develop the pretext, but more importantly understand the goal that the pretext aims to achieve 

	* *Understand Reality vs Fiction*. It is easier to remember the pretext if it is based in reality and one can use their experience or knowledge . Keep the pretext realistic for the target so that they are not suspicious. *Do not pretend to have knowledge that you don't., especially when the other person has this.*

	* *Know how far to go*. You do not have to create a [[Lenses for the Experience#The Look and Feel of a World is Defined by Its Aesthetics|detailed backstory]]. People will only care about what they have to in order to complete the social contract you have created.  

	* *Avoid short term memory loss*. Use a few techniques to remember important details 
		* Have being able to write things down as part of the pretext 
		* Use business cards (after establishing rapport) 
		* Use recording devices 
		* Have a partner

	* *Get support for pretexting*. Play the part convincingly. The little details will help support the pretext.

	* *Execution of the pretext*. Be prepared to adapt on the fly. Practice. Stay Calm. Communicate with the right people at the right time. Do not use a script. 

* The pretext serves as the bridge between [[Communication#Framing|your frame]] and your target's frame. 

## Attack Plan, Attack Launch, and Reporting
* **Attack Plan** 
	* What is the plan? 
	* What is the goal? 
	* What is the best time to launch the attack? 
	* Who needs to be available at a moment's notice for support or assistance 
* **Attack Launch** - use an outline rather than a [[Narrative|script]]. 
* **Reporting** - report what went well or poorly in the attack. 

* Some attack vectors to consider
	* **Phishing** - use malicious emails that pretend to be reputable sources with the goal of 
		* Delivering malicious payloads that give remote access 
		* Gathering credentials 
		* Gathering further intel. 
	* **Educational Phishing** - use curiosity, greed, happiness or fear to get people to click. Tailor the phishing to these aspects of the client. The goal is to be geared towards informing vulnerabilities 
	* **Pentest Phishing** -  use fear, greed, surprise or sadness. The goal is not just a click but remote access
	* **Spear Phishing** - a personalized form of phishing that considers the target's personal information
	* **Vishing** - phishing over the phone. Usually used for 
		* Harvesting credentials to gain access.
		* OSINT, particularly to verify details. 
		* Full compromise. 
	* **SMiShing** - using SMS messaging, typically geared towards loading malware on the device or stealing credentials. 
		* The key is brevity. Just facts and links 
		* Leave domains that look similar to the attack. 
		* Make sure the link leads to a believable website. 
		* Make the procedure of gathering information simple -- do not make the user perform many actions. 
	* **Impersonation** - most dangerous and also riskiest.  This requires proper planning 
		* Gather information about the site and to develop a plausible pretext. 
		* Develop your pretext before you attack. 
		* Understand the goals of the attack from start to finish. 
		* Ensure all necessary equipment are on hand. 
		* Make sure to have a get out of jail free card. 

## Mitigation and Prevention Plan 
* At the end of the day, the goal of pentesting and social engineering (for good) is to develop actionable mitigation and prevention plans to improve infrastructure security. 

* *Step 1: Learn to Identify Social Engineering Attacks*. Understand what actual attacks might look like and what they can do to the institution. Social engineering helps teach both how to recognize and take a hit. 

* *Step 2: Develop Actionable and Realistic Policies*. 
	* The plan should require minimal thinking from the client. Too many policies are broad and general that they leave too much thinking to the client rather than the expert. 
	* Remove the ability for empathy bypasses. Suggest policies for employees to help others without compromising company security. 
	* Make the policy as detailed as possible. A realistic policy is one which helps the employee see the situation rom all angles. It should be unambiguous and give a clear direction on what to take. 
	* Good policies explain both what and why. 
	* Good policies train the employees to react with muscle memory. 

* *Step 3: Perform Regular Real-World Checkups*. Check how well the policy stuck by using a test. 

* *Step 4: Implement Applicable Security-Awareness Programs* By making security-awareness programs applicable to your clientâ€™s specific needs, you can help their employees learn not only what not to do, but also what they should do when and if something bad happens
# Considerations
* *Leave them better off for having met you* 
	* If things are not panning out, back off. 
	* Use pretexts that do not have long-lasting negative emotional effects on the target
* As a professional social engineer, you are influencing or manipulating the emotional content of your target
* Do not underestimate how easy people can fall for human hacking. 

* Considerations for pentesting
	* What do you record? 
	* The client should be aware of each step of the pentest. 
	* Obtain written permission. 
	* Consider the [[Data Analytics|data story]]
	* Don't share successful exploits on social media.

* *Document everything*. Even things that are not used in OSINT and even sensitive information that, while not used in the pentest, may be of interest for the client's safety
	* Be professional, the report will be read by many people. 
	* Grammar and spelling checks. 
	* Be detailed. The client will appreciate your knowledge. Give them enough details to know what to do next. 
	* Suggest ways to mitigate vulnerabilities. These suggestions should be actionable. 
* *Be judicious with Pretext* 
* The right emotional trigger at the right time to the right people leads to massive success.
