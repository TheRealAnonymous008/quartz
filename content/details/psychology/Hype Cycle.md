<figcaption> The Hype Cycle. Taken from Schell</figcaption>

* The **technology trigger** - when the technology is first discovered or announced.
* **Peak of inflated expectations** - when "nobody knows what it's like but everyone says it's great".
* **Trough of disillusionment** - when the technology can't live up to the incredible hype that surrounded it. It quickly becomes unfashionable and despised. 
* **Slope of enlightenment** - people and businesses start to figure out the areas where the technology is actually useful and beneficial.
