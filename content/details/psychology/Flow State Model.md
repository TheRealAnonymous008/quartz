* The **flow state** pertains to the state of mind where:
	* There is:
		* *A challenging activity that requires skills*.  The flow activity is not passively experienced. It requires active and directed engagement.
		* *Clear goals 
		* *Clear feedback*. 
		* *The Paradox of Control* - the participant is able to exercise control without completely being in control of the situation.
			* If there is no chance of failure, the activity is not difficult enough
			* If the participant has no control, they probably do not have sufficient skill level.
	* And the participant experiences:
		* *Merged actions and awareness* The person stops being aware of themselves as separate from the actions they are performing
		* *Concentration*. Flow activities carve out their own experiential spaces for participants. 
		* *Loss of Self-Consciousness* - the participant's sense of self is subservient to the greater whole of the experience. He becomes a part of the larger system. 
		* *The Transformation of Time* - the feeling that time shrinks or stretches. 

* It is the emotional and psychological state of focused and engaged happiness.
