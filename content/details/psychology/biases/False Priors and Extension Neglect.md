* **False Priors** are biases that are based on false priors and assumptions.
* **Extension Neglect** are biases based on neglecting the sample size.
# Extension Neglect
* **Base Rate Fallacy** - the tendency to ignore relevant statistical information in favor of case specific information. In a [[Probability|Bayesian]] manner, it involves not taking into account the prior probability (base rate) of an event.
	* *Example*: The tendency to say that people from a certain course have a particular quirk; The tendency to jump to conclusions based on stereotypes.
	* One reason why we ignore the base rate is because *we believe it to be irrelevant to the judgment we are making*, and thus we do not integrate it to our conclusions.
	* Another reason is the *representativeness heuristic* wherein we see a prototype for a category as representative of its whole category. Thus, what applies to the prototype applies to the whole and vice versa.
# False Priors
* **Agent Detection** - the inclination to presume the purposeful intervention of a sentient or intelligent agent in situations that may or may not involve one.

* **Automation Bias** - the tendency to be over-reliant on automated aids and decision systems.

* **Stereotypes** - a generalized belief about a particular category of people, including expectations about a particular group.
