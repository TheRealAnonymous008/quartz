* The discomfort felt when holding two contradictory attitudes, beliefs, or behaviors.
* *Example*: Doing something even though you know it's wrong.
* Dissonance Theory suggests people reduce their cognitive dissonance to achieve consistency. For example:
	* By changing the behavior
	* Justifying the behavior by changing the conflicting cognition
	* Justifying the behavior by adding new behavior 
	* Ignore or deny information. Selective exposure theory also suggests this response.
* Despite the dissonance, people may be unwilling to change their beliefs in light of new information because: 
	* The change may be painful or involve loss.
	* The present behavior may be otherwise satisfying
	* Making the change may simply not be possible.

* **Normalcy Bias** - people underestimate the likelihood of a disaster when it might adversely affect them. This is despite threat warnings.

* **Effort Justification** - attributing the value of an outcome one puts effort into achieving as greater than the objective value of the outcome.

* **IKEA Effect** - consumers place a high value on products they partially created.
	* It can be attributed to a *psychological need to feel competent*. Feeling like weâ€™re incapable at something increases our desire to prove ourselves and appear competent.
	* Another reason is *effect justification*. When we put effort into something, we want to believe there was a good reason to do so.
	* Another reason is that *we like things we associate with ourselves*.

* **Ben-Franklin Effect** - people like someone more after doing a favor for them. The rationalization is that they help others because they like them.


* *Cognitive Dissonance is not necessarily a bad thing*. Consider separating negative feelings and beliefs and doing positive actions.
