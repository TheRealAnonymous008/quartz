* The **Association  Fallacy** can be formalized as follows -- 
  $A$ is in [[Set Theory|set]] $S_1$
  $A$ is in set $S_2$
  $B$ is also in set $S_2$
  Therefore, $B$ is in set $S_1$.

* The **Galileo Gambit** is a form of association fallacy made as follows -- 
  
  $X$ was ridiculed for their scientific observations but $X$ was later acknowledged to be right
  Therefore, $Y$'s non-mainstream views, which provoke ridicule, will later be recognized as right.

* **Authority Bias** is the tendency to attribute greater accuracy to the opinion of an authority figure (unrelated to its content), and be more influenced by that opinion.
	* It arises because *individuals are taught to respect and obey authority figures*. This eventually becomes a heuristic. 
	* It also ties with [[Confirmation Bias]] since we may use the authority figure to justify our existing beliefs.
	* It may also be reinforced by the halo effect.

* The **Cheerleader effect** is an effect where people perceive individuals as more attractive in a group than when seen alone.

* The **Halo effect** is an effect where positive impressions of an entity in one area positively influences one's opinions or feelings. 
  
  It is when evaluators are influenced by their previous judgments. 
	* It occurs because constructing impressions of others is a constructive process based on our perception (which is inherently biased). 

* The **Beautiful is good [[False Priors|stereotype]]** is one where physically attractive individuals also possess desirable personality traits.
