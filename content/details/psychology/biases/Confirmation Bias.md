* The tendency to look for information in a way that supports one's [[Bayesian Statistics|prior]] beliefs or values, and ignoring contrary or using ambiguous evidence.
* This arises due to how *our brains use heuristics to quickly prove our beliefs*. Another reason is that we perceive this bias as *protecting our self-esteem* by protecting us from false beliefs we tie to our identity.
* This can manifest as:
	* Biased searching for information (i.e., to confirm hypotheses)
	* Biased interpretation of information 
	* Biased memory recall of information

* **Backfire Effect** - maintaining a belief despite information that firmly contradicts it. There are three subtypes based on where they stem from
	* **Familiarity Backfire** - from making myths more familiar
	* **Overkill Backfire** - from providing too many arguments
	* **Worldview Backfire** - from providing evidence that threatens someone's worldview.

* **Congruence Bias** - testing a hypothesis directly rather than testing possible alternatives. Thus, people rarely try experiments that can disprove their initial belief, rather they try to repeat their initial results.

* **Observer's Bias** - the tendency to certify data that meet expectations and to disbelieve data that contradicts those expectations.

* **Observer Expectancy Effect** - when a researcher expects a given result and thus unconsciously manipulates an experiment to find it. The presence of a researcher can influence the behavior of participants in their study.
	* It arises due to *demand characteristics*, subtle cues given by the researcher to the participants about the nature of the study.

* **Selective Perception** - the tendency to perceive what one wants to perceive while ignoring opposing viewpoints.

* **Semmelweis Reflex** - the reflexive tendency to reject new evidence or new knowledge because it contradicts established norms, beliefs, or paradigms.
