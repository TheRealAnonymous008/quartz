* Prospect theory assesses the loss and gain perspectives of individuals. *Losses are not perceived equally as Gains*

* The following principles govern Prospect Theory
	* **Adaptation Level** - evaluation is relative to a neutral reference point. *Tastes are not fixed, they vary with this reference point*.
	* **Diminishing Sensitivity** - sensitivity depends on scale. Small increments are only noticeable at small scales.
	* **Loss Aversion** - There is an asymmetry where we weigh a loss more than an equal gain.
		* Evolutionarily, this makes sense. An organism that perceives threats as more urgent survives better.
		* A byproduct of this is a single bad in many good things stands out more, and a single good in many bad things stands out less.
		* When we make decisions, we undervalue [[Scarcity, Supply, and Demand|opportunity costs]]
		* *This makes negotiations more difficult*. the exploitation of market power to impose losses on others is unacceptable

* **Ambiguity Effect** - the tendency where decision making is affected by a lack of information. People select options for which the [[Probability]] of a favorable outcome is known.
	* Can stem from a heuristic to avoid options where information is missing.

* **Disposition effect** - the tendency of investors to sell assets that have increased in value and keep assets that have dropped in value.
	* We sell valuable assets because we are risk-averse with gains. The increased value increases certainty in these assets.
	* We keep depreciated assets because we are risk-seeking with loss. *We take the risk that these assets will gain value some time in the future.*

* **Dread Aversion** - dread yields double the emotional impact of savoring

* **Endowment Effect** - people are more likely to retain an object they own than acquire the same object they do not own. 
	* Another way to say this is *loss aversion associated with parting from an owned item*. We see that we lose the item we own rather than what we gain from parting with it.
	* Another way to view this is that the item is valued differently between the buyer and the seller. Thus, it may happen because *people do not want a bad deal*. It happens when there is a gap between a buyer's willingness to pay and a seller's willingness to accept a price.
	* Can also be attributed to liking things associated with [[Egocentric Biases|ourselves]], this extends to "psychological ownership" where we think we own the item even if we do not physically own it.

* **Pseudocertainty effect** - the tendency to perceive an outcome as certain when it is actual uncertain in multi-stage decision making.

* **Status Quo Bias** - a preference for the status quo. Losses and gains are taken with reference to the status quo. 
	* A corollary to this is a resistance to change.
	* We prefer the norm because we perceive deviation as a loss, and we want to avoid regrets that may stem from deviating from the safety of the norm.
	* We prefer the norm to reduce uncertainty and risk and the cognitive load this brings.

* **System Justification** - the tendency to defend and bolster the status quo. Alternatives are disparaged even at the expense of individual or collective self-interest.
