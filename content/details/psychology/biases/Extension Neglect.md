* **Extension Neglect** are biases based on neglecting the sample size.

* **Base Rate Fallacy** - the tendency to ignore relevant statistical information in favor of case specific information. In a [[Probability|Bayesian]] manner, it involves not taking into account the prior probability (base rate) of an event.
	* *Example*: The tendency to say that people from a certain course have a particular quirk; The tendency to jump to conclusions based on stereotypes.
	* One reason why we ignore the base rate is because *we believe it to be irrelevant to the judgment we are making*, and thus we do not integrate it to our conclusions.
	* Another reason is the *representativeness heuristic* wherein we see a prototype for a category as representative of its whole category. Thus, what applies to the prototype applies to the whole and vice versa.

* **Compassion Fade** - the tendency to behave more compassionately towards a small number of identifiable victims than to a large number of anonymous ones [^comp_fade]
	* Can be attributed to the *affect heuristic* - we make decisions when we feel emotionally attached.
	* Most apparent in the saying that "one is a tragedy, a million is a statistic ". 
	* Some effects:
		* **Identifiable Victim Effect** - people are more willing to help a single identifiable victim than multiple non-identified ones.
		* **Pseudo-inefficacy** - people are less willing to provide aid once they become aware of the larger scope of people whom they are unable to help. 
		* **Prominence Effect** - an individual favors the option that is superior based upon the most important attitude. 
		* **Proportion dominance effect** - people are not motivated to save the maximum number of lives but are motivated to help causes which have the highest proportion of lives saved

* **Conjunction Fallacy** - the tendency to assume that specific conditions are more probable than a more general version of those same conditions. That is, people perceive that
  
  $$
  P(A\wedge B) \ge P(A), P(B)
  $$

* **Duration Neglect** - also called the peak-end rule. People's judgments of the unpleasantness of painful experiences depend very little on the duration of those experiences
	* We remember a [[Faculties of the Mind#Memory|memory]] or judge an experience based on how they felt at the peak moments, as well as how they felt at the end
	* Some explanations for why
		* The **representativeness heuristic** - an event is judged not by its entirety but by snapshots which trigger an emotional response.
		* Individuals demonstrate better memory for events that are more emotionally intense
		* Individuals tend to remember the end because of [[Other Biases|recency bias]]. 

* **Hyperbolic Discounting** - valuations fall relatively rapidly for earlier delay periods (as in, from now to one week), but then fall more slowly for longer delay periods (for instance, more than a few days).
	* *People make choices today that their future selves would prefer not to have made, despite using the same reasoning*,. 
	* We tend to choose immediate rewards over rewards that come later in the future, even when these immediate rewards are smaller.
	* It incentivizes impulsivity and immediate gratification and blinds us to the benefits of long-term decision making
	* Some explanations for why this happens
		* We favor options that are certain. We are risk averse by default.
		* Waiting is difficult.

* **Insensitivity to [[Probability and Statistics|Sample Size]]** - a probability is judged without respect to sample size. People under-expect variation in small samples.

* **Less-is-better effect** - the lesser or smaller alternative of a proposition is preferred when evaluated separately, but not evaluated together.
	* *Defects tend to make something seem less valuable even when these defects are negligible*
	* Some explanations for why it happens
		* Our perception of the world is context-dependent. Putting options side by side provides context for both
		* The **Evaluability Hypothesis** - we have a harder time evaluating some attributes than others and when we’re trying to judge objects in isolation, our impressions are much more heavily influenced by features that are easily evaluated. *We lack information about what the average value is*.
		* Some features stand out more than others.

* **Neglect of Probability** - the tendency to disregard probability when making a decision under uncertainty.

* **Scope Neglect** - the valuation of a problem is not valued with a multiplicative relationship to its size.

* **Zero Risk Bias**  - the tendency to prefer the complete elimination of risk in a sub-part over alternatives with greater overall risk reduction
	* Could be attributed to and enhanced by a [[Framing Effect]]
