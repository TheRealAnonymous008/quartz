* These are biases that rely on immediate examples that come to a person's mind when evaluating a topic. That is, it is the biased belief that *if it can be recalled, it must be important than information not readily recalled*. 
	* It is important to realize that *our memories are not necessarily good models for forecasting future events*
	* Another contributing factor to this bias is how certain memories are easier to recall than others. Hence, simply relying on recall does not give us the full picture.
	* *Our memories can be primed*, which also makes them unreliable.

* **Anthropocentric Thinking** - the tendency to use human analogies as a basis for reasoning.

* **Anthropomorphism** - the tendency to characterize non-human things as possessing human-like traits. It involves making use of one's schemas about other people as a basis for inferring the properties of non-human entities.

* **Attentional Bias** - perception is affected by recurring thoughts. It may help explain failure to consider alternative possibilities when already occupied with an existing train of thought.

* **Frequency Illusion** - once something has been noticed then every instance of that thing is noticed  

* **Implicit Association** - the biased belief that the speed at which people can match words depends on how closely they are associated. Faster implies more strongly associated concepts based on past experiences.

* **Isolation Effect** - when multiple homogeneous stimuli are presented, the stimulus that differs from the rest is more likely to be remembered.. Some explanations include:
	* Isolated items are *rehearsed for a longer time in working memory* compared to non-isolated items
	* Subjects could consider the isolated items to be *in their own special category* in a free-recall task, making them easier to recollect.
	* The *contextual incongruity* of the isolate is what leads to the differential attention to this item. Thus,  giving context removes this effect.

* **Salience Bias** - individuals focus on or attend to items that are more prominent, visible, or emotionally striking. Thus, more salient information is favored.
	* It can be attributed to *a sudden contrast between items and their surroundings* .
	* It manifests itself in the psychological process of *cognitive ease* where we make use of heuristics to reduce the time needed to think and process stimuli. *This ease comes by making decisions based on salient features*
	* Some elements may become salient over time as we gain the habit of noticing them only at a particular moment. Thus, *saliency and this bias depends on context*.
	* *Saliency is also dependent on our personal interests*. 

* **Selection Bias** - the bias introduced by the non-representative selection of data for analysis. This leads to faulty statistical analysis. This comes from:
	* Sampling biases 
	* Early termination of trials at a time when the results support the desired conclusion.
	* **Susceptibility bias** - when people who are susceptible to the development of an outcome are also prone to be exposed
	* Cherry picking
	* **Attrition Bias** - discounting subjects that did not participate until the end of the experiment.
	* **Observer Selection** - data are filtered not only by study design but also by the precondition that someone is observing the data. Another way to phrase it is, *the universe seems to be finely tuned for life but this is necessarily true (for us) since we are intelligent life*
	* **Self-Selection or Volunteer Bias** .

* **Survivorship Bias** - concentrating on entities that passed a selection process while overlooking those that did not. This leads to incorrect conclusions due to incomplete data. 
	* This comes from *mistaking a subgroup as being representative of the whole population*.
	* This can be attributed to the fallacy of "correlation implies causation".

* **Well travelled road effect** - frequently travelled routes are assessed as taking a shorter time than unfamiliar routes.
