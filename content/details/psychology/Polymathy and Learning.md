* *Humans are limitless in their capacity for development. Thus, people should embrace all knowledge and develop their capacities as fully as possible *

* Although creative products, such as a painting, a mathematical model or a poem, can be domain-specific, at the level of the creative process, the mental tools that lead to the generation of creative ideas are the same

# Bernstein's Typology of Creative Life Stages 
* The specialist has depth of knowledge but lacks breadth of knowledge 
* The dilettante demonstrates breadth but acquires skills for their own sake without regard to understanding their broad applications 
* The polymath is a person with a level of expertise that is able to put a significant amount of time and effort into their avocations and find ways to use their multiple interests to inform their vocations

 | 3    | Polymathic from the outset and can juggle multiple careers simultaneously so that their creativity pattern is constantly varied |
 | 4    | Recognized for one major talent but go on to explore additional creative outlets, diversifying their productivity with age      |
 | 5    | Devote themselves serially to one creative field after another                                                                  |

# Principles of Learning 
* *Learning is self-active*. The learner learns through their own activities. It is a personal process. 
* *Learning is purposive*. Learning is moving towards a goal or end results. Learning experiences are meaningful if they relate to personal interests. 
* *Learning is creative*. Learning is not just a summing up of previous knowledge but a synthesis of knowledge.
* *Learning is transferable* - whatever is learnt in one context will apply to another context or situation

* **Readiness** - the basic [[Models for Human Needs|needs]] of the student must be satisfied before they are ready or capable of learning. This includes, physical, mental, and emotional needs. 
* **Exercise** - learning continues during practice. Practice creates habits and is directed towards a goal.  The things that are most often repeated are the ones that are best remembered. 
* **Effect** - every learning experience should contain elements that leave the student with some good feelings. Learners will strive to learn as long as it provides a positive effect. 
* **Primacy** - the instructor must present subject matter in a logical order, step by step. The things learnt first often leave a strong impression that is difficult to un-learn. Thus *learn it right the first time*. 
* **Recency** - things most [[Framing Effect|recently]] learned are best remembered 
* **Intensity** - the more intense the material taught, the more likely it will be retained. Students learn more from the real thing than a substitute. 
* **Freedom** - students must have the freedom -- of choice, of action, to bear the results of action. A lack of freedom leads to a disinterest in learning. Compulsion and forcing are not favorable for  personal growth. 
* **Requirements** - we must have something to obtain or do something.
