# The Call To Transformation

|  | Call | Remember it is in our nature to... | Transformation | Essential Quality |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | To live for a Higher Purpose | Be wise and discerning | To realize that they can suspend our judgment about what they should do. <br><br>Accept reality as it is, and to accept ourselves as we are. and not what is our ideal. | **Perfection** - The universe is perfect as it is, as all things unfold as things ought to. <br><br>All parts of the whole, even the flawed, contribute to create something more than the sum of its parts. This comes with the knowledge of the necessary amount -- the perfect amount for everything |
| 2 | To nurture yourself and others | Be good to yourself and have goodwill and compassion to others | To realize that they aren't going to heal their hearts through self-sacrifice. <br><br>Love is not a commodity. Real Love is present in ourselves and others | **Freedom** -   Love is omnipresent. We do not need to give or to get love from others.<br><br>We have love and value. We are love and value, embodied. There is no need to search for more. |
| 3 | To develop yourself and set an example for others | Take pleasure in your existence and to esteem and value others | Let go of the notion that their value is dependent on the positive regard of others. <br><br>The mask must come off and the inner emptiness must be acknowledged. They become genuine, striving to be no more or less than they really are. | **Hope** - We are valuable because we exist. We imbue value on the things around us. We cannot be without value, we can only forget that it is there. |
| 4 | To let go of the past and be renewed by your experiences | Be forgiving and use everything in life for your growth and renewal | To realize that there is nothing wrong with them and so no one needs to rescue them. <br><br>To be themselves requires no effort. They are already a living work of art -- cycling between creation and transformation | **Origin** - We can create their own lives. Our true self is ever changing due to experiences, and is made richer because of them<br><br>We can grow from experience. When we allow ourselves to be touched by life, we are changed.  |
| 5 | To observe yourself and others without judgment or expectations | Be engaged with reality, contemplating the infinite riches of the world | To stop observing and to experience. The answer to a question arises not from<br>a chattering brain but from a clear mind that is attuned to reality<br><br>There is nothing to fear with reality because they are a part of it. | **Clarity** - the lack of attachment to any particular point of view. Any position is useful within a limited context. <br><br>We are all connected, and we can experience this connection. Everything is an infinite bounty. |
| 6 | To have faith in yourself and trust in the goodness of life | Be courageous and capable of dealing with life under all conditions | To realize how much they are already supported, even in the little things. <br><br>The support they have been seeking has always been available -- in their own Being, inside of them manifesting as an inner emptiness that can be filled with potential | **Faith** - a real and immediate knowing that comes from experience. Belief with experience that is made into guidance. <br><br>Being supports us because we are part of it; Our existence has Being. It cannot not have Being.  |
| 7 | To joyously celebrate existence and share your happiness | Be happy and to add to the richness of experience for everyone | To realize that fulfillment is not the result of “getting” anything: it is a state of<br>being that arises when we allow the richness of the present moment to touch<br>us<br><br>To see the divine potential in even the material things.  | **Ecstasy** - the natural experience that arises spontaneously when we experience ourselves as Being -- when we quiet our minds. <br><br>Life is the greatest gift (and so is everything within it). There was nothing wrong with it to begin with.  |
| 8 | To stand up for yourself and to speak out for what you believe | Be strong and capable of affecting the world in many different positive ways | To understand the roots of their defensiveness.  To open the heart once more to see a forgotten innocence that was always there. <br><br>To surrender themselves to a higher plan -- beyond their self-interest. To realize that they were always powerful and they have no need to assert this power. <br> | **Innocence** - the primal, and instinctive satisfaction of being alive -- in simply experiencing existence as it is. The quality of being child-like. <br><br>Humans function as part of a balanced natural order. True power comes from aligning oneself with the Divine.  |
| 9 | To bring peace and healing into your world | Be an inexhaustible font of serenity, acceptance and kindness to the world | To realize that the only true way to achieve unity is to engage themselves in the present moment. They must confront their negative emotions. <br><br>We cannot transcend the human condition, we can only embrace it -- our true nature.  | **Holy Love** -  a dynamic quality of Being that breaks all barriers before it. In dissolving these boundaries, we reconnect with others and realize the Essential Love has been with us all along.<br><br>Everything in the Universe is interconnected. <br> |
