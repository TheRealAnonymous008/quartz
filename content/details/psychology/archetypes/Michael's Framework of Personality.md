* Under this system, we can observe parallels to [[Jungian Archetypal Characters|Jungian archetypes]]
	* The **persona** layer is the cover to hide the shadow.
	* The **shadow** is hidden underneath a layer of negativity and denial. It is single-minded, desperate, being driven by their worst fears.
	* **Fear** is at the core of emotions. This is reminiscent of the [[Enneagram of Personality]]. The character's flaw is an attempt to avoid a kind of fear. 

* Each chief feature has a fundamental fear associated with them. They are characterized with stopping this fear from coming true.
