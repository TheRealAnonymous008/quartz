* The Enneagram is based on the [[Seven Deadly Sins]] as well as the [[Kabbalah]]
* The Core Truth of the Enneagram is that we are much more than our personality. Our basic type reveals the psychological mechanisms by which we forget our true nature—our Divine Essence—the way in which we abandon ourselves
* Each basic fear is a reaction to the universal fear of death and annihilation -- the fear of nothingness.  
* In response to a basic fear, a basic desire emerges, often sought to be fulfilled in misguided ways.
