* The Enneagram is based on the [[Seven Deadly Sins]] as well as the [[Kabbalah]]
* The Core Truth of the Enneagram is that we are much more than our personality. Our basic type reveals the psychological mechanisms by which we forget our true nature—our Divine Essence—the way in which we abandon ourselves
* Each basic fear is a reaction to the universal fear of death and annihilation -- the fear of nothingness.  
* In response to a basic fear, a basic desire emerges, often sought to be fulfilled in misguided ways. 

* The process of growth entails an ongoing cycling among letting go of old blockages, opening up to new possibilities in ourselves, and then encountering deeper levels of blockage.
* *Presence always reveals what in us is blocking us from becoming more present.*
	* We fully experience our Presence as a living being here and now. 
	* We take in the impressions of our internal and external environments completely and without judgment or [[Stoicism|emotional reaction]].
	* We are fully participating in the moment. 

* People typically require a shock to go from an average level to unhealthy behaviors. *The unhealthy behaviors associated with each type is associated with a self-abandonment*. 
* In the healthy range of behavior, we eventually reach the *liberation point -- where we no longer identify with the ego*. It is the realization that we have the qualities we were looking for. 
* There are two directions in the Enneagram 
	* The **Direction of Integration** integrates the development towards wholeness for each type. It is associated with becoming healthier. 
	* The **Direction of Disintegration** shows what behaviors manifest when the type's behavior is pushed to the limit. It is associated with becoming more dysfunctional. 
	* Movement along either direction occurs more or less on the same level (so healthy to healthy, average to average, unhealthy to unhealthy)
	* More volatile personalities tend to move along the direction of disintegration. 
	* Integration requires a more conscious choice to let go of the hindrances associated with each type.

* *Each type's vice leads to an inherent contradiction*


|  | Contradiction |
| ---- | ---- |
| 1 | To seek integrity and wholeness but to judge parts of the self as "good" and "bad" (i.e., dividing the self) and to constantly strive for a perfection whose standards keep rising.  |
| 2 | To look for endearment and love while missing the genuine love that is offered by others. To want to be loved yet to be defensive when others suggest that they have their own needs. |
| 3 | To achieve something yet not feel genuine satisfaction for the achievement. To lie to themselves and focus on their self image rather than on developing their true self or nurturing their own needs. The praise they receive is for their image, not for their real self. |
| 4 | To see oneself as unique and "not like others" and yet to both deny the positive qualities of the self that is shared with others, and to see others as normal while the self as flawed. They are aware of their flaws, and feel and project their disappointment to others or retreat to a Fantasy Self.   |
| 5 | To seek knowledge and skills but instead of being motivated by fear.  They must always prepare but preparations are never enough, and eventually this means they have never lived a life, only prepared for it.   |
| 6 | To seek security in others but also fear that they will be abandoned by their support group.  They become dependent on someone to become independent. They seek a perfect authority where none exist. They have many commitments but stretch themselves too thin |
| 7 | To seek satisfaction, yet to also be distracted -- anticipating rather than experiencing and as a result never being satisfied of the present moment. To fill the self with more rather than be "bored" and confront an existing need.  To seek the best experience when finding it is impossible. |
| 8 | To seek independence by being in control without realizing that they are reacting to others and so they are dependent on them for satisfaction. To constantly push against life with intensity yet as a result have less energy to connect, and the world feels muted.  |
| 9 | To seek safety by detaching from the world and "becoming nobody" at the cost of making everything feel muted. To want to be at peace with the world and yet to be so detached with it.  To seek value in others yet to be disengaged with them that they cannot connect with the self.  They want to be left alone yet they never voice their anger at others when they prod. |
