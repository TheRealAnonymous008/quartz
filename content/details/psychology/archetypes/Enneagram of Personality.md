* The Enneagram is based on the [[Seven Deadly Sins]] as well as the [[Kabbalah]]
* The Core Truth of the Enneagram is that we are much more than our personality. Our basic type reveals the psychological mechanisms by which we forget our true nature—our Divine Essence—the way in which we abandon ourselves
* Each basic fear is a reaction to the universal fear of death and annihilation -- the fear of nothingness.  
* In response to a basic fear, a basic desire emerges, often sought to be fulfilled in misguided ways. 

* The process of growth entails an ongoing cycling among letting go of old blockages, opening up to new possibilities in ourselves, and then encountering deeper levels of blockage.
* *Presence always reveals what in us is blocking us from becoming more present.*
	* We fully experience our Presence as a living being here and now. 
	* We take in the impressions of our internal and external environments completely and without judgment or [[Stoicism|emotional reaction]].
	* We are fully participating in the moment. 

* People typically require a shock to go from an average level to unhealthy behaviors. *The unhealthy behaviors associated with each type is associated with a self-abandonment*. 
* In the healthy range of behavior, we eventually reach the *liberation point -- where we no longer identify with the ego*. It is the realization that we have the qualities we were looking for. 
* There are two directions in the Enneagram 
	* The **Direction of Integration** integrates the development towards wholeness for each type. It is associated with becoming healthier. 
	* The **Direction of Disintegration** shows what behaviors manifest when the type's behavior is pushed to the limit. It is associated with becoming more dysfunctional. 
	* Movement along either direction occurs more or less on the same level (so healthy to healthy, average to average, unhealthy to unhealthy)
	* More volatile personalities tend to move along the direction of disintegration. 
	* Integration requires a more conscious choice to let go of the hindrances associated with each type.

# The Types 
* **One - The Reformer** - have a sense of mission that leads them to want to improve the world in various ways while at the same time having the feeling that they have to justify their actions to themselves.
