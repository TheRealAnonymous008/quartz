* Composition is the [[Pattern Structure|relation]] between elements of a picture.

# Elements
* **Framing** - the region that demarcates what is part of the art work. *The eyes look at the frame as a whole*
	* Consider how objects are proportioned in relation to each other or to empty space.
* **Space** - divided into two. The **positive space** is what is drawn. The **negative space** is what isn't.
	* If negative space dominates the art work, the insignificance of the subject becomes the focus.
	* If positive space dominates, then thee details of the subject are what's important.
* **Contrast** - the difference between elements. *It distinguishes elements from each other*. This distinction makes certain elements pop.
	* The more contrast, the more chaotic and cluttered the piece.
	* The less contrast, the more ordered the piece looks.
* **Rhythm** - *the degree of repetition between visual elements*. 
	* Rhythms can create patterns which appear pleasing to the eye.
	* Breaking the rhythm tends to cause elements to [[Human Biases|stand out]].
	* Rhythm gives an additional structure to the piece.
* **Focal Point** - *where we want the viewer too look*. With compositional techniques, we are able to [[Visual Design|control where the viewer looks]].
	* The eyes naturally focus on the center of the image, as defined by the rule of thirds.

# Techniques
* Use thumbnails to [[details/creativity/design/DOET/Design Thinking|prototype]] the general composition of the image.
* Draw only the basic image, using basic shapes and little to no detail. *[[Construction Drawing]] the image own into basic shapes*
* Composition is the balance between positive space, negative space, and focal points.
	* Balance is about achieving the appropriate amount of contrast.
* [[Perspective Drawing]]
* Flip the image horizontally or vertically to get a fresh perspective.
