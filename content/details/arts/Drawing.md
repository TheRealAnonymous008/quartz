* In a sense, all drawing is the same. Drawing is about projecting how you see the world onto a medium. *Artists have a unique way of [[Faculties of the Mind|seeing]] the world*.
	* In order to draw a perceived subject -- something seen with the eyes, requires a [[Conceptual Blocks to Ideation|shift]] to using the more [[Faculties of the Mind|visual-spatial]] aspects of the mind instead of our more symbolic, semantic, language-dominated perception.
	* Ask yourself questions related to space rather than to the subject itself. Think in terms of lines, shapes and curves
	* *Draw what you see without thinking about what it is.* [^see]
	* *The way you paint is a record of how you see*.  (from [[Color and Lights by Gurney|Gurney]]).
* The fundamental skills of drawing are as follows:
	* Perceiving edges -- the shared edges or boundaries between two objects
	* Perceiving space 
		* Perceiving negative space is important especially for complex contours. If you can see the negative space and draw its boundary, you will have drawn the original object
	* Perceiving relationships -- includes proportion and perspective
	* Perceiving lights and shadows (i.e., shading)
	* Perceiving the whole -- composition
* *Drawing is nothing but copying the thing you see*. That being said, drawing also allows the artist to put into the medium, the unique way they see the world.

[^see]: Edwards shows this using the exercise of drawing an image upside down. This reduces our "inner voice's" tendency to semantically describe the image. We rely only on the visual information
