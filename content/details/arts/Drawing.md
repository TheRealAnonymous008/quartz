* In a sense, all drawing is the same. Drawing is about projecting how you see the world onto a medium. *Artists have a unique way of [[Faculties of the Mind|seeing]] the world*.
	* In order to draw a perceived subject -- something seen with the eyes, requires a shift to using the more [[Faculties of the Mind|visual-spatial]] aspects of the mind.
	* Ask yourself questions related to space rather than to the subject itself. Think in terms of lines, shapes and curves
	* *Draw what you see without thinking about what it is.* [^see]

[^see]: Edwards shows this using the exercise of drawing an image upside down. This reduces our "inner voice's" tendency to semantically describe the image. We rely only on the visual information
