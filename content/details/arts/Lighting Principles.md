# Lighting
* Consider that light not only comes from the main light source (i.e., sunlight or a spotlight) but also from light reflected off of other objects in the scene (see [[Illuminating Rendered Objects|here]]).
	* When light is reflected from $X$ to $Y$, it not only adds light to $X$ but it also adds some of the hue of $Y$ onto $X$ .
	* *General Principles of Reflected light*
		* In shadows, up-facing planes are cool and downfacing planes are warm.
		* Reflected light falls off following the inverse square law.  Thus, it falls off rapidly.
		* The effect of reflected light is more apparent when all other sources of reflected light and fill light are removed.
		* The color of a shadow is the sum of all the sources of reflected illumination.

* Remember that the brightness  of any point source illumination diminishes following the [[Mechanical Waves|inverse square law]].

* **Hard Light** comes from a sharp, small point. 
	* It tends to be more directional and more dramatic. 
	* It produces crisper shadows.
	* It brings out more surface textures and highlights.
* **Soft Light** comes from a more diffuse source.
	* It tends to be more easy on the eyes.
	* It reduces the confusion of cast shadows.
	* It reduces the contrast between light and shadow. Objects tend to transition between the two in a more gradual manner.

* *Diffusing light through a material or passing it through translucent material makes it softer.*.

* **Luminescence** -- light emitted at cool temperatures,  tends to follow the following principles.
	* They often graduate from one hue to another.
	* Blue-green colors are the most common in the ocean because those wavelengths travel the farthest through water. 
	* *Paint the scene darker first then add luminescence and glowing effects*.

* You can use lighting, in particular, lighting from occluded objects, to add intrigue and guide the viewer's eyes.

* *Lighting affects the value* and can make dark tones appear brighter than lighter tones.
## Lighting Techniques
* Consider the **lighting ratio** -- the tonal separation between light and shadow. *Softer lighting reduces the lighting ratio; Harder Lighting increases it.*.
* Most portraits are painted in **Three Quarter Lighting** where light comes from $45\degree$ in front of the model. This illuminates the majority of the model.
* **Rembrandt Lighting** involves arranging the light so that the nose shadow merges with the side of the face.  
	* This results in a lighted triangle on the cheek closest the viewer.
	* The triangle should be no longer than the nose and no wider than the eye.

* **Frontal Lighting** involves light shining directly towards the model from the viewer's perspective.
	* In this case, very little shadow is visible. 
	* It emphasizes local color or pattern. 
	* *It creates apparent outlines* -- which are simply the fringes of shadows appearing at the edge of a form. 

* **Edge Lighting** comes from behind to touch the sides of the form. 
	* It requires a strong light source directed towards the viewer. 
	* *It creates apparent highlights* -- blobs of lighter regions appearing at or along the edge of a form.

* **Contre-Jour** is a form of backlighting where the subject blocks the light. 
	* The light surrounds the object's edges.
	* *It makes the silhouette of the form more apparent while muting some of the details.*
	* The regions of light are not pure white. They diffuse slightly.

* **Light from Below** is associated with underlighting or theatrical footlights. It rarely occurs in nature.
	* *It grabs the viewer's attention*.
	* It suggests a magical, sinister or dramatic feeling.
	* It can make the familiar appear unfamiliar since we usually see things with the light shining from above.
	* It can make an object look bigger if only parts of it are lit from below by small weak lights.
 
 * **Spotlighting** involves shining a spotlight on an object.
	 * The spotlight *allows the viewer to focus on a part of the image* by placing it in bright light and placing the rest in shadow. 
	 * *Shadows as a result of the spotlight being occluded should match the ambient light*.
# Form

* The **terminator** is the area where the form transitions from light to shadow.
	* Geometrically, it is where light rays from the source are tangent to the edge of the form.
	* If the light is soft, the transition at the terminator will be more gradual
	* The form's shadow begins beyond the terminator.

* The **core shadow** only forms if the secondary source of light doesn't overlap too much with the main light.
	* Adding the core to the piece gives the form more impact.

* *Texture is difficult to see in the shadow*. It is much more visible in fully lit areas, especially in the **half light** region

* *In soft light, there is no distinct light, shadow, terminator or core*. Lighting depends on which sides are facing the source of diffused light. 

* A **Shadow** is formed when an object occludes light. 
	* *Shadows suggest depth*. 
	* *Shadow is not pure darkness*. Other sources of light will modify the shadow. 
		* Reflected light raises the tone of the shadow.
		* The darkest part of the shadow is at the point of contact. 
	* The edge of a shadow gets softer as the distance increases from the object that casts the shadow.
	* Dark accents occur at places where forms come close enough to each other. This leaves a dense area of shadow called a  **Crevice Shadow / Occlusion Shadow**
		* Common in cases where materials push together in folds or at points of contact with the ground.

* One way to create drama and visual interest (esp. in a vertical form) is to have the top be in light and the rest in shadow.

* *Not all material can be decomposed into form and subsequently lit*. Consider materials that respond differently to light.  Typically this involves variations in the material's density or composition
