## General Principles 
* When it comes to drawing hair, it is best to *think in clusters rather than strands*. In order to give the illusion of strands, apply a bit of texturing and [[Color Theory|coloring]].
* Hair should follow the surface of the head and its curvature. 

## Front 
* The *front section* includes the mass of the hair at the front of the face (excluding any facial hair)
* The *hairline* is the edge of the hair growth on the forehead.  There are [different types of hairlines](https://www.healthline.com/health/hairline-types)
	* *Low hairlines* are close to the eyebrows and make the forehead look shorter. Younger people typically have a low hairline. 
	* *Middle hairlines* sit in the middle of the forehead 
	* *High hairline* are close to the crown of the head


## Sides 
* The *side section* includes the region of the hair which curves around the head. It includes the region above the ears and potentially flowing towards the neck. 

## Back 
* The *back section* includes the mass of hair from behind the head and in the nape area. 

## Facial Hair
