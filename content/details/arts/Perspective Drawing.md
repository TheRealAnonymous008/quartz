* One technique from [[Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain by Edwards|Edwards]] is to close one eye (esp. if the object is close). Copy the flattened projection that you see. Closing the eye removes the effect of depth perception.
* We can handle proportion by using an object in the view as a reference and drawing other objects in the scene with reference to its size.
