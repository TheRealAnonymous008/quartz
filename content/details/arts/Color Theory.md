# Color Wheel 
* **Hue** - the name of the color family (i.e., Red, Green, Blue, Cyan, Yellow, or Magenta)
	* A **Tone** is a pure hue with neutral gray added.
* **Saturation** - pertains to how intense or dull the color is. Specifically, it is the intensity of the light proportional to brightness.
	* **Shade** is a related quality. It is the color obtained when black is added to the color .
	* **Tint** is another related quality. It is the color obtained when white is added to the color.
	* **Gray** is defined as a neutral color (low saturation)

* **Chroma** is a similar quantity which pertains to the perceived strength of a surface color seen in relation to white.
	* *Saturation and Chroma are not the same*. 
	  
	  Chroma can be modified by changing the lighting of the scene
	  Saturation is invariant to lighting and is more dependent on how "faded" or "intense" the object would appear under bright light. 

* **Value** - pertains to how light or dark the color is  
	* The **Peak Chroma Value** is the value of a given hue that gives the greatest chroma. 

* A **Complement** is the color that appears directly across the color wheel. 
	* *When complements are mixed, the result is neutral gray*.  

* **Local Color** pertains to the color of the surface of an object as it appears up close in white light. 
	* *Local Color is not the same as Perceived color*.
	* The colors used in the actual piece will be the local color with a slightly modified hue, saturation or value. This comes about due to the effect of Lighting. 

## Palette / Schemes 
* **Analogous** - directly next to each other in the color wheel. The colors farther away from the primary color have increased saturation. 
	* Typically creates a softer design with less contrast. 
* **Monochromatic** - one hue with varying values (going light to dark). 
* **Complementary** - use two colors that are directly adjacent from each other on the color wheel. 
	* The traditional approach is one color is dark and desaturated, the other is light and saturated.
	* It tends to evoke high contrast.
* **Split Complementary** - create a Y on the color wheel.  That is, one dominant color and the two colors adjacent to the dominant color's complement. 
	* All colors provide contrast. Two colors work great together but more than two will require more balance.
* **Triadic** - choose three colors that are equally placed in lines around the color wheel. 
	* Tends to create high contrast while retaining saturation. 
	* Gives a bright and lively appearance. 
* **Square** - choose four equidistant colors from each other. Typically, we choose one dominant color than try to balance all four.

## Color Moods 
* Low value  = Low Contrast and Sharper. High Value = Harsher
* Low saturation = Low energy. High saturation = High energy. 
* Closer to Red = Warmer. Closer to Blue = Colder 
* The key is to balance low and high value. Low and High Saturation.  

* *All mood relies on context*. 
* Start with grayscale to analyze the role of contrast in the image.

## Techniques
* Grays accentuate the brighter colors of the image. 
	* *It tends to be better to derive grays from mixing complementary pairs*. 
* One way to desaturate is to mix in the complementary color to add grays to the image. 
* *A low saturation image can be enlivened by shifting value and hue.*
* Do not have overall saturation too high.

 * *Greens tend to look intense, especially outdoors*  See [here](https://gurneyjourney.blogspot.com/2008/06/green-problem.html) . Some tips
	 * Remove green from the palette and mix them from blues and yellows to get weaker and more varied greens.
	 * Vary the greens 
	 * Mix pink or red into the piece.

* **Gradiation** can come in multiple ways -- gradual variations in hues, saturations or values.

* *Tints / Adding White creates a more pastel color or a feeling of light permeating in the image*

* *Keep your palette limited*.  Often you only need at most four or five colors (with mixing allowed).
