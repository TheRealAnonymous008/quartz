# General Principles 
* When it comes to drawing hair, it is best to *think in clusters rather than strands*. In order to give the illusion of strands, apply a bit of texturing and [[Color Theory|coloring]].
* Hair should follow the surface of the head and its curvature. 
* Hair should generally fall down (in the direction of [[Gravity]]). Exceptions exist depending on circumstance. 

# Front 
* The *front section* includes the mass of the hair at the front of the face (excluding any facial hair)
* The *hairline* is the edge of the hair growth on the forehead. There are [different types of hairlines](https://www.healthline.com/health/hairline-types)
	* *Low hairlines* are close to the eyebrows and make the forehead look shorter. Younger people typically have a low hairline. 
	* *Middle hairlines* sit in the middle of the forehead 
	* *High hairline* are close to the crown of the head. Typically older people have a high hairline (due to it receding)
	* *Straight*
	* *Widow's peak* there is a distinctive V-shape 
	* *Triangular* - the opposite of a widow's peak giving the appearance of an off-center triangle.
	* *M-shaped* - this is typical of receding hairlines 
	* *Uneven* - there is no apparent symmetry.  
	* *Bell-shaped*  

* *Bangs / Fringes* are strands of hair that fall over the scalp's front hairline. They typically cover up to the eyebrows (but hairstyles can cover longer). Some example types are provided below 
	* *Blunt* - have a sharp fluid cut running straight laterally .They typically work best with hair that is naturally straight or thick.
	* *Wispy* - have a soft, thin look. Typically works best with low hair densities. 
	* *Micro* - short bangs that reach about an inch down the forehead. 
	* *Curtain* - bangs that are cut shorter in the middle (giving a V-shaped frame for the face). 
	* *Side* - similar to a curtain bang except off center, giving a slightly skewed V or a ramp shape (since the hair naturally curves away  from the parting).
	* *Long* - bangs that reach beyond the eyebrows or even up to the cheeks. 
	* *Choppy* - like blunt bangs except with a more textured look coming from variations in the length of each individual strand / hair clump. 
	* *Layered* - bangs that have layers to add texture and volume. It is in between having no bangs and small bangs. 
	* *Feathered* - typically for straight hair. The hair is layered with either a side or center parting. The hair would then be brushed to the sides to give a feathery appearance (like a bird) .
	* *Shaggy* - like curtain bangs except the bangs are wispy, and have choppy layers, giving an unkempt appearance 
	* *Bottleneck* - combines curtain bangs with a wispy appearance. They give the appearance of a bottleneck because they start shorter at the top and grow longer at the sides

* Some general principles for bangs: 
	* The bangs flow from the hairline. 
	* Consider how far down the bangs reach. Typically they reach down to the eyebrows but they could be longer. 
	* Consider hair density. Bangs will seem more wispy if the hair density is lower. 
	* Bangs occupy volume and so they do not perfectly rest flat on the forehead. They must have a bit of a puffy appearance. 
	* Bangs can be parted represented with a gap in the hair. The parting is either in the center or off to the side. 
	* Bangs can be layered represented with having clumps of bangs that have varying lengths 
	* A rougher appearance can be achieved by introducing small gaps (distinct from the main parting) or inconsistent hair lengths. 
	* The texture of the bangs should match that of the rest of the hair -- if the rest of the hair is straight, the bangs should be straight as well. 

# Sides 
* The *side section* includes the region of the hair which curves around the head. It includes the region above the ears and potentially flowing towards the neck. 
* The side hair has *volume*. Make sure to not put the hair directly on top of the head / scalp. Instead, account for space above the scalp where the hair rests.
* Side hair can have *layers* which can be represented by having hair clusters of different lengths. 
	* Hair in this case can be long or short.
* The side hair originates from the *hair swirl*. It is a line on the top of the head from which all hair originates and grows away from.
* Consider that the hair could be *parted* or not parted. In the case that it is parted, In the region where the parting happens it acts like a swirl from which the hair seems to originate out of. 
* The side hair's [texture](https://www.healthline.com/health/beauty-skin-care/types-of-hair#style-and-care) should be consistent with the rest of the hair. The following is a list of textures possible for side hair [^s1]. 
* [Walker's Hair Types](https://www.oasisbeautykitchen.com/blogs/oasis-skin-blog/from-straight-to-kinky-the-ultimate-hair-care-guide) is a good listing for consideration
	* *Type 1 - Straight* - no natural curl. Completely straight from root to tip. Tends to be shiny and appears flat
	* *Type 2 - Wavy* - has a gentle wave pattern. Thicker than straight hair. Often has tangles or split ends. 
	* *Type 3 - Curly* - more defined curl pattern from loose curls to tight spirals. Curls go in an S pattern. 
	* *Type 4 - Kinky* - very tight Z curl pattern. Typically found in afro hair.

[^s1]: Note, this is applicable for front and back as well. 

* Consider as well the thickness of the hair. This corresponds to how "visible" the scalp is.
	* A completely bald human will not have any hair, however keep in mind the shape of the head. 
	* Convey "thin" hair using dots.
	* Thicker hair is conveyed using clumps of hair (as standard)

# Back 
* The *back section* includes the mass of hair from behind the head and in the nape area. 
* Aside from texture, the primary concern is hair length. 
* Men's hair will be typically shorter (at most only reaching up to the nape.) This is dependent, however, on hairstyle. 
* Women's hair will be longer.
