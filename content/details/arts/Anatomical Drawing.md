* A collection of notes on drawing anatomies, with art style and medium abstracted away as much as possible. 
# General Guide
* The three anatomical planes are useful as a reference for [[Construction Drawing|construction]] lines. Directional modifiers are also included. In parentheses are the "common" terms that will be used for convenience. 
	* **Transverse plane**  - the plane that separates the head from the feet 
		* A view from the bottom or top is taken to be a slice of the coronal plane 
		* **Superior (Above)** - closer to the top 
		* **Inferior (Below)** - closer to the bottom. 
	* **Coronal Plane** - the plane that separates the front and the back 
		* A full frontal or back view is taken to be a slice of the coronal plane 
		* **Ventral** - the belly or lower side.
		* **Dorsal** - the back or upper side
		* **Anterior (Back)** - pertaining to the back 
		* **Posterior (Front)** - pertaining to the front. 
	* **Sagittal Plane** - the plane that separates the left half from the right half 
		* A side view is taken to be a slice of a sagittal plane . 
		* **Lateral (Side)** - closer the left or right side 
		* **Medial (Middle)** - closer to the middle 

* *Notation*: For convenience, lines that pass through the transverse, coronal, and sagittal plane will be referred to as frontal, longitudinal and sagittal lines.  [^1]

* Masses are decomposed into fundamental shapes that are easier to draw and capture the general shape. Corresponding anatomical parts are also provided. 
	* In general *remember that the masses exist in 3D*. Applying principles of [[Perspective Drawing]] help. The depth of each mass is, ideally, apparent. 
	* Lines that are drawn should *follow the curvature of the body*.

[^1]: Technically these should be seen as axes of the body, but lines that are "close enough to being parallel" to these lines are also counted together.
