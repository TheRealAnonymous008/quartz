* The key principle to this is that -- *visual art is, at its base level, about assembling shapes together to create a figure*

* Construction is about breaking complex objects down into simpler shapes. *It is about observation*.

* Incorporate [[Perspective Drawing]].
	* The goal of learning construction is to *build a better understanding of forms*

* Consider practicing by drawing the contours. This allows ne to also see proportion. 
	* However, note that this does not imply following the outlines of the image

# Techniques
* The trick is to look for basic shapes including
	* Circles / Spheres 
	* Squares / Cubes
	* Triangles / Cones
	* Rectangles / Cylinders
* *Start with a granular construction and then gradually refine it.*
	* At every pass, the construction's form should become more apparent. It should gradually feel more solid.
	* Whenever a new mass is added, make sure that it emphasizes an understanding between the different forms added. 
* The construction of the drawing shouldn't follow the original drawing.

* Look for the ways a form flows in 3D space.
