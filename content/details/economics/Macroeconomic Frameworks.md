# Aggregate Supply and Demand 
* An extension of [[Scarcity, Supply, and Demand]] from a Macroeconomics perspective applying to total supply and total demand. 
	* The *ag*
* The total quantity of output is measured via real [[Macroeconomic Quantities|GDP]] compared to each price level.  The price level is the price for final goods bought in the economy. 

# Keynesian Perspective 
* **Keynes' Law**: Demand creates its own Supply 
	* The economy often produced less than its full potential because there was no demand to incentivize production.
	* Note that it does not take into account how the economy can be constrained by its production capabilities
	* It is a good approximation of the short-term behavior of the economy.

# Neoclassical Perspective
* **Say's Law**: Supply creates its own Demand.
	* Each time a good is produced and sold, it generate income earned by someone.
	* Note that this does not explain why recessions and high unemployment occurs
	* It is a good approximation of the long-run behavior of the economy.
