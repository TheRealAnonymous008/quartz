# Aggregate Supply and Demand 
* An extension of [[Scarcity, Supply, and Demand]] from a Macroeconomics perspective applying to total supply and total demand.
* The total quantity of output is measured via real [[Macroeconomic Quantities|GDP]] compared to each price level.  The price level is the price for final goods bought in the economy. 
 
* The aggregate supply curve shows how producers as a group will respond to an increase in aggregate demand. *Higher demand = more produced*.
	* Near the point of the potential GDP, the AS curve grows steeper.
	* The level of production in aggregate supply can cross the potential GDP. In this case, the economy is working under hyper-intense production. However, this is not sustainable in the long run. 
* The aggregate demand refers to the total amount of domestic goods and services in the economy at each price level.  *Higher price level = Lower spending*.
	* Aggregate demand is dependent on consumption spending, investment spending, government spending, and net exports. 
	* There are three effects at play. These effects do not seem to be very large. 
		* The **wealth effect** means that as price increases, the buying power of savings diminishes. 
		* The **interest rate effect** means that as prices increase, the same purchases will take more money to accomplish. This pushes interest rates higher which reduces borrowing and investment spending. 
		* The **foreign price effect** means that a higher domestic price level relative to price levels in other countries will reduce net export expenditures.

* *The AS and AD curves intersect at the equilibrium point. At equilibrium we see the real GDP of the economy and the average price of all goods sold.*

## Shifts in Aggregate Supply and Demand 
* Like in the microeconomic model, shifts in aggregate supply and demand induces a change in the equilibrium point. 
* The following factors can affect aggregate supply 
	* *In the long run, the most important factor shifting the AS curve is productivity growth*. Productivity means that the same quantity of labor can produce more output (GDP) while at the same time lowering prices.
	* *Higher prices for inputs that are widely used (i.e., energy, rent, and labor) shifts the AS curve left*. This induces less GDP and raises prices bringing a recession and higher unemployment.
	* **Supply shocks** are sudden, unexpected events that induce a shift in the supply curve. For example, the effects of the weather, war, or a pandemic. *Shocks tend to reduce aggregate supply at all price levels* which also leads to shortages .

* The following factors can affect aggregate demand. 
	* *Any change in the factors affecting demand* (see [[#Keynesian Perspective]]) -- consumer spending, investment spending, government spending, and net exports. An increase in these factors leads to an increase in total spending.
	* *Confidence in the economy* plays a factor in increasing consumer and investment spending. More confidence = more spending = More output at a higher price level at equilibrium. 
	* [[Macroeconomic Policy]] concerning government spending or tax rates. Higher taxes / interest rates = Lower consumption. 

## Modeling The Whole Economy
* Key economic issues are illustrated in the AD/AS model 
	* *Long-run economic growth due to productivity* increases over time will be represented by a gradual shift to the right of aggregate supply
	* *Recessions occur when the real GDP is significantly below potential GDP*. Conversely, economic growth means that the real GDP is closer to the potential GDP. 
	* *Potential GDP can imply different unemployment rates* in different economies, depending on the natural rate of unemployment for that economy
	* *Unemployment is measured by how close the economy is to full GDP employment level*. The factors contributing to unemployment are implicitly part of potential GDP.
	* *If equilibrium is at the steep portion of the AS curve, then we have inflation*. This can arise due to a shift in demand 
	* *A shift in supply to the left is indicative of inflation*. As a result, equilibrium GDP decreases while price levels increase.

* In the **Keynesian Zone**, the SRAS curve is flat. 
	* The equilibrium level of real GDP is far below potential GDP
	* The economy is in recession, 
	* Cyclical unemployment is high. 
	* Inflation becomes less of a concern here since price level does not vary.
* In the **Neoclassical zone**, the SRAS is steep. 
	* The equilibrium level of real GDP is close to potential GDP 
	* Demand shifts have little effect. 
	* Cyclical unemployment is low. 
	* Inflation becomes a concern as shifts in demand can raise price levels. 
* In the **Intermediate zone**, we observe that unemployment and inflation move in opposite directions 
# Keynesian Perspective 
* **Keynes' Law**: *Demand creates its own Supply*
	* The economy often produced less than its full potential because there was no demand to incentivize production.
	* Note that it does not take into account how the economy can be constrained by its production capabilities
	* It is a good approximation of the short-term behavior of the economy.
* Keynesians posit that the economy is often in the Keynesian Zone of the AS/AD model. 

* AD is volatile. It can fall to the **recessionary gap** where unemployment is high, or it can rise to the **inflationary gap** where the economy is in inflation'

* There are three factors that can affect consumption expenditure 
	* *Disposable Income* - how much income they have after taxes. 
	* *Expected  future income* - optimistic consumers are more likely to spend. This also factors in how likely a consumer is to save their earnings. 
	* *Wealth or credit* - an increase in wealth means a potential increase in consumption. 
* Investment expenditures are primarily affected by expectations about the future. *Business investment is the most variable of all the components of aggregate demand*
	* *Expectations of future profits*. If the firm perceives a growing market, they are more likely to invest. 
	* *Interest rates and investment costs* - lower interest rates and costs means that businesses invest more.  
* Government policy plays a role in shifting aggregate demand 
	* More government spending = more demand. 
	* Higher taxes = lower demand.
* Net exports are determined by the following 
	* Changes in relative growth rates between countries. If a country is in a recession, exports are likely to decline.
	* Changes in relative prices between countries. If goods become relatively expensive, then exports are likely to decline 

* *Recessions happen for two reasons*
	* Aggregate demand is not always automatically high enough to provide firms with an incentive to hire enough workers to reach full employment
	* *Sticky wages and prices means that the macroeconomy adjusts slowly* [^keynes_1].
		* One such reason is the [[Macroeconomic Goals#Recessions|relative coordination argument]].
		* *Sticky prices arise because of costs.*(1) It costs resources to dictate a new price; (2) **Menu costs** mean there is a cost for changing the price 

[^keynes_1]: As is typical for most systems related issues, A [[System Dynamics|delay]] becomes a problem.

* The **expenditure multiplier** means that a change in spending causes a more than proportionate change in GDP. *This arises because one person's spending is another person's income which leads to more income and spending*.

* The **Phillips Curve** suggests that when the level of output is at or even pushing beyond potential GDP, the economy is at a greater risk for inflation. Thus, *there is a tradeoff between unemployment rate and inflation rate*
	* The Philips curve is downward sloping in this case.
	* The Phillips curve is unstable. Trying to balance unemployment and inflation leads to stagflation where both unemployment and inflation are high.
	* The Phillips curve is valid in short periods, but when aggregate supply shifts over long periods, it shifts. 

* Keynesians argue that the solution to a recession and high unemployment is an **expansionary fiscal policy** that can  *stimulate consumption and investment*
* A proposed solution for high inflation is a **contractionary fiscal policy** where tax increases or spending cuts *reduce consumption and investment*.

* Regardless, *Keynesian policies require knowing how much aggregate demand there is in the moment*. 
* It also risks ignoring the long term factors contributing to economic growth or the natural unemployment rate that exists even when the economy is producing at potential GDP.
* It views inflation as a price for lower unemployment.
# Neoclassical Perspective
* **Say's Law**: *Supply creates its own Demand.*
	* Each time a good is produced and sold, it generate income earned by someone.
	* Note that this does not explain why recessions and high unemployment occurs
	* It is a good approximation of the long-run behavior of the economy.

* Neoclassical economists posit that the economy is often in the Neoclassical Zone of the AS/AD model.
* The Neoclassical Perspective is built on two principles
	* The potential GDP determines the economy's size 
		* Long term economic growth is seen in increases in the quality of physical capital, human capital, and technology. 
		* *Short term fluctuations around potential GDP exist*, but in the long run, the potential GDP determines the economy's size. 
		* In the long run, the AS curve is simply a vertical line at the potential GDP. *Shifts in demand only lead to shifts in price level*
	* *Wages and prices will adjust in a flexible manner* so that the economy will adjust back to the potential GDP level of output.
		* The economy cannot sustain production above its potential GDP in the long run
		* Surges in aggregate demand that drive production to be above potential GDP causes an increase in price level rather than output.
		* Because of flexible prices, the economy will rebound out of a recession on its own, or contract during an expansion.

* The **theory of rational expectations** holds that people form the most accurate possible expectations about the future using all information available. *In an economy where people have rational expectations, economic adjustments may happen quickly*
* Another theory is **adaptive expectation** - where people look at past experience and [[Bayesian Statistics|update]] their models accordingly. 

* *There is always a temporary trade-off between inflation and unemployment; There is no permanent tradeoff.*
	* The Phillips curve from the Neoclassical perspective is a vertical line at the level of natural unemployment indicating inflation rate could be anything for as long as the economy is at the natural unemployment rate.

* It advocates for **hands off policies** which proposes that over long-term, prices will stabilize on their own.  *Governments should worry about long-term growth and controlling inflation than on recession and unemployment*
	* Aggregate demand should be allowed to expand only to match the gradual shifts of aggregate supply to reduce the effects of inflation.
	* Because of the Phillips curve, government policy is more concerned with the natural  unemployment rate when the economy is operating at potential GDP. *The goal is to reform the labor market to reduce the natural rate of unemployment*. 

* The Neoclassical model is not helpful in explaining why unemployment is volatile over the short ter. It is also not helpful for economic depressions.
* It views inflation as a cost with no gains in terms of lower unemployment.
