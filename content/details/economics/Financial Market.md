* **Financial market** - the market for saving (producers) and borrowing (consumers). 
	* The good that is supplied is **financial capital**, the amount loaned. 
	* Interest arises from the expectation that the borrowers will return the money. It effectively acts as the "price"

* Higher interest rates mean that borrowers reduce demand and increase supply. 
* How producers save their [[Money]] affects supply. Similarly, how consumers borrow money affects demand.  
* *Usury laws act as price ceilings.* 

* Financial markets are prone to the problem of [[Consumer Behavior and Transactions#Information in the Market|incomplete and asymmetric information]]

# Insurance 
 * **Insurance** is used to prevent any single event from having a significant detrimental financial effect. 
* Entities make regular payments in the form of premiums priced by the insurance company based on the probability of certain events occurring. 
	* These payments must cover the average person's claims, the cost of running the company, and leave room for the company's profits. 
	* Insured entities are *classified into risk groups*. 
* *Insurance inherently plays with imperfect information* - the certainty of having a bad event or that an insured person is affected by it. 
* *Insurance companies earn income from both insurance premiums and investments*.
	* If insurance premiums accurately reflect the individual's risk levels, there is less incentive for high-risk individuals to buy insurance. 
	* Government policy may also require consumers to buy insurance to assure insurance companies of an inflow of cash. 

* Due to imperfect information, Insurance companies face a **[[Information Hazards|moral hazard]]** where people engage in riskier behavior since they know they are insured. It can be reduced in a few ways 
	* Investigations to check for insurance fraud 
	* Require the policyholder to pay out of their own pocket in the form of **deductibles** before the company itself pays. 
	* Incentivize producers rather than consumers (for example, incentivize healthcare professionals). The producers are paid a flat amount and provided more by the insurance company through **copay**
		* *More copay can be incentivized to those who are not likely to experience something bad covered by insurance*

* Insurance buyers also face the **adverse selection problem** where they have more information about which risk group they belong to more than the insurance company. 
	* This means that high-risk individuals buy more insurance without informing the insurance company and low-risk individuals do not buy insurance. 
	* This is mitigated through policy -- either do not allow high-risk individuals to buy insurance or require low-risk individuals to pay more than a fair amount. 

# Financial Investments
## The Demand for Capital
* Firms can raise financial capital in the following ways 
	* *From early-stage investors*
		* This can either come out of pocket from the business owner, or from the owner's assets as collateral 
		* Investors can also come from angel investors or from venture capitalists who invest in small companies with potential and give them advice. 
	* *By reinvesting profits* 
		* Profits can be reinvested in additional physical capital.
		* Firms do not rely solely on profits since it can fluctuate
	* *By borrowing through banks or bonds*  - The firm, through reputation, can make a credible promise to pay interest. 
		* Here, *the firm is more in control on its operations, but it must pay for the loan*.
		* Bank borrowing is more customizable than bonds so it tends to be better for smaller businesses.
			* A **checking account** is one that pays little interest but facilitates transactions easily .
			* A **savings account** pays some interest but the money requires one to make a trip to the bank to access. 
			* A **certificate of deposit** involves an agreement where the household deposits an amount for a certain period of time, and in exchange the bank will pay them higher interest.  *There is a penalty for early withdrawal from the account.*
		* Larger firms tend to gravitate towards issuing bonds.
			* **Junk bonds** are bonds that have high interest rates to compensate for the relatively high chance of defaulting. 
	* *By selling stock*
		* Stocks represent shares in firm ownership. 
		* An **initial public offering (IPO)** is when the company first sells its own stock to the public 
		* Often, when a firm that buys corporate stock the invested firm does not receive any of the money.  
		* Investors are paid direct payments via **dividends** or indirectly by reselling the stock, in which case they have **capital gains**.
		* Here, *the firm is in less control of its operation, but is more visible*

* A **corporation** is a business that incorporates -- it is owned by shareholders not liable to the company's debt but shares in its profits and losses.
	* A **private company** is owned by the people who run it. It can either be a **sole proprietorship** (one person) or a **partnership** ( group ran)
	* A **public company** is one which sells stocks and where shareholders own it via a board of director. Stocks dictate ownership. 

* Due to imperfect information, Those who are actually running a firm will almost always have more information about whether the firm is likely to earn profits in the future than outside investors who provide financial capital.
	* **Corporate governance** pertains to entities that watch over top executives. This comes in three levels -- the shareholders, the auditing company that review the firm's financial records, and outside investors.
	* *Corporate governance aims to mitigate imperfect information*

## The Supply of Capital 
* Household investments vary in terms of three factors 
	* The **expected rate of return** the investment will pay. This pertains to the expected return on investment (in percentage)
	* The **risk** that the return will be much lower or higher than expected. 
		* **Default risk** is the risk that the borrower fails to pay back the bond or loan 
		* **Interest risk** is the danger of charging a lower interest rate before the market rate suddenly rises. 
	* The investment's **liquidity** -- how easily it can be exchanged for goods and services. 

* A general recommendation for investors is **diversification** - buy stocks and bonds from a wide range of companies. 
	* **Mutual funds** - consists of a variety of stocks and bunds from different companies. The scope of a mutual fund can vary from broad to very specific. The return is based on how well the fund as a whole performed. 
	* **Index fund** - a mutual fund that seeks only to mimic the market's overall performance. 

* An **equity** is the monetary value the owner of a property would have after selling these properties and repaying any outstanding bank loans used to purchase the assets.
* *Investing in tangible assets can lead to both financial and non-financial returns*. 
	* The idea here is to pay low and sell high and receive capital gains.
	* The rate of return is moderate if there are non-financial benefits as well (i.e., there is utility to this.)

| Option | Return | Risk | Liquidity |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Checking Account | Very low | Very little | Very high |
| Savings Account | Low | Very little | High |
| Certificate of deposit | Low to medium | Very little | Medium (since withdrawing early is penalized ) |
| Bonds | Low to medium  depending on risk | Low to medium depending on volatility of market rates | Medium since investor needs to sell the bond |
| Stocks | High over extended periods since the trend is generally up | Medium to high due to the volatility of the stock market, especially apparent in the short run | High  since stocks can be sold |
| Mutual Funds | Medium to High due to diversification | Medium to High due to diversification | Medium to High due to diversification |
| Housing | Medium | Medium | Low |
| Gold  | Medium  | High  | Low  |
| Collectibles  | Low to Medium  | High  | Low |

* It is hard to get rich quick because if many people are trying to do this, because this drives market prices high. *Stock price is speculative -- it depends on expectations of the firm's performance*.  It is hard to become an [[Thinking Fast And Slow|expert]]. 
* Getting rich relies on making investments -- specifically on their own investments, and on saving money early.
