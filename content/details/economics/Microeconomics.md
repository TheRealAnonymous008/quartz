* The **Invisible Hand** dictates that economies are generally predictable even if they are [[Complex Systems]]. 
	* This holds for as long as two principles hold 
		* That there is enough competition among buyers and sellers 
		* That all agents in the economy operate with [[Game Theory|rationality]]. 
	* It also suggests that Pareto optimality can be achieved even among selfish agents [^opp_2]
	* *Supply and demand reveal themselves through the behaviors of producers and consumers.*

[^opp_2]: See more [[Static Games of Incomplete Information|here]]. Incomplete information and uncertainty also helps. 

* *All choices are governed by [[Trade Offs|tradeoffs]] due to scarcity of resources*
* Every market is more or less subject to the laws of supply and demand. We can analyze the dynamics of the market using a four step process that analyzes the relationship between the two. 
	* Identify the supply and demand curves and the equilibrium point
	* Decide whether the economic change affects supply and demand 
	* Decide how it affects supply or demand (does it induce a shift to the right or the left) . If there are multiple variables and effects, analyze each individually. 
	* Compare the new equilibrium to the old equilibrium
