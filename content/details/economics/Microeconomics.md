# Scarcity, Supply and Demand
* *All choices are governed by [[Trade Offs|tradeoffs]] due to scarcity of resources*
	* An **opportunity cost** pertains to what people must give up to obtain something else they want. *It is the value of the next best alternative*.
	* *Every choice has an opportunity cost.*
	* *Opportunity cost is not necessarily tied to money*. There is also time and effort to consider as well as the fact other opportunities are lost. 
	* [[Static Games of Complete Information|Knowing the opportunity costs can alter behavior]].
* **Marginal analysis** - a form of analysis where we examine the costs and benefits of choosing a little more or a little less of a good. 
* **Utility** pertains to the perceived value of a particular good. 
	* *A rational consumer purchases additional units of a product as long as marginal utility is greater than opportunity cost*.
	* In rational decision making [[Logical Fallacy Biases|Sunk costs]] should not affect decisions.

* Generally, we can model scarcity and opportunity costs using either of the following
	* **Budget constraint** - all possible combinations of goods someone can afford, given the prices of goods, and assuming all income is spent. We use the relative prices of two goods (which are fixed). 
	* **Production Possibilities Frontier** - indicates all possible allocations of a budget towards producing certain resources.  
		* This is subject to the law of diminishing returns where the gains towards one production is determined by how much has already been spent towards it. 
		* Along the production frontier, we have **Productive efficiency** which means that *it is impossible to produce more than one good without decreasing production for another.*
		* We can contrast productive efficiency with **allocative efficiency** where a particular combination of goods and services represents a socially desirable combination [^opp_1]
	* Both of the above capture scarcity, tradeoffs, economic efficiency, and the self-interested nature of entities within the economy. 

[^opp_1]: This is analogous to [[Game Theory - Strategy|Pareto optimality]]. 

* The following assumptions are assumed when it comes to opportunity costs 
	* **Law of diminishing marginal utility** -  the more a person receives of a good, the less additional marginal utility. 
	* **Law of increasing opportunity cost / Law of diminishing returns** - as production of a good or service increases, the marginal opportunity cost of producing the good increases as well.
		* This happens because some resources are better suited for some produce more than others. 
		* The gains towards producing one good is determined by how much of the budget was already spent on it. 

* Economies, due to different circumstances, tend to have *different opportunity costs for various resources* and for producing various goods.
	* These differences give rise to **comparative advantages** of a certain good. 
	* When entities engage in trade, they specialize in the production of the goods in which they have comparative advantage. This maximizes production and surplus for both parties. 

* The **Invisible Hand** dictates that economies are generally predictable even if they are [[Complex Systems]]. 
	* This holds for as long as two principles hold 
		* That there is enough competition among buyers and sellers 
		* That all agents in the economy operate with [[Game Theory|rationality]]. 
	* It also suggests that Pareto optimality can be achieved even among selfish agents [^opp_2]
