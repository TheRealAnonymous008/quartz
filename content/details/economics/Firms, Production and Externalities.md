* A **Firm** is a producer or business. It combines *inputs of labor, capital, land, and component materials to produce outputs* 
* A successful firm is one where the *outputs are more valuable than the inputs*.
# Firm Structure 
## Production
* *Production requires various inputs* 
	* *Natural Resources* - the raw materials needed for making the product, as well as the land on which production will be made. 
	* *Labor* - physical and mental human effort
	* *Capital* - the physical assets that are needed to produce the product 
		* Capital is fixed in the short run.
	* *Technology* - the process for producing the product. 
	* *Entrepreneurship* - the decision making process that guides how inputs produce output. 

* Production can be summarized with a **production function**. Here $\text{TP}$ stands for total product
  $$
  \text{TP} = f(\text{NR}, L, K, t, E)
  $$
  
* The inputs of production may either be **fixed** or **variable** depending on how easy it is for them to change in a short period of time. 
	* A shorthand for the production function considers the variable inputs $L$ and fixed inputs $K$, written as $\text{TP} = f(L,K)$

* The **short term** is the period of time when some factors of production are fixed. 
	* Because capital is fixed short term. the production function in this case is of the form $\text{TP}=f(L)$. 
* In the **long term**, all factors are variable. 

* The **marginal product** is the additional output of one worker. It is with respect to labor $L$

* *Production in the short-run is characterized by the **Law of Diminishing Marginal Product***. This arises because fixed capital acts as a limiting factor.
* *Production in the long run allows convergence towards the most efficient way to produce any level of output*. This is because all production factors are variable.

## Cost
* **Cost** pertains to the expenditures paid for producing and selling the products 
	* **Explicit costs** are actual payments (i.e., wages)
	* **Implicit Costs** pertain to the [[Scarcity, Supply, and Demand|opportunity cost]] of using resources that the firm already owns, as well as the depreciation of goods.
		* *Sometimes even if more profitable opportunities exist, the implicit cost prevents firms from switching*

* **Accounting profit** pertains to explicit cash. It only considers the explicit cost. 
* **Economic profit** pertains to a measure of economic success. It considers both explicit and implicit costs. 

* For every factor of production, there is an associated **factor payment** paid for the use of said factors. 
	* **Raw Material Prices** for raw materials 
	* **Rent** for land and buildings 
	* **Wages and Salaries** for labor 
	* **Interest and Dividends** for the use of financial capital 
	* **Profit** for entrepreneurship. 

* The cost depends on how much labor and physical capital the firm uses. 
	* Costs can be fixed or variable depending on if they correspond to fixed or variable inputs. 
		* *Fixed costs do not change in the short run*
		* Fixed costs are essentially **overhead**. We can *spread the overhead* by allocating other inputs (such as labor) towards paying for them. This works since fixed costs do not change (assuming no additional capital).
	* The total cost is denoted $\text{TC}$
	* **Average Cost** is one cost metric calculated with respect to $Q$. 
	* **Marginal Cost** is another cost metric. It is with respect to quantity. 

* *Cost increases as the firm produces higher quantities of product*. In the short term this is because of diminishing marginal product.
	* Marginal cost is generally upward slowing due to diminishing returns. 
	* Low marginal costs pull down the average cost, and conversely high marginal costs pull the average cost up. 

* *The pattern of costs varies among industries and even among firms in the same industry*

## Long Term Costs 
* In the long run, firms will consider alternative **production technologies**. The choice of production technology is dependent on the needs of the firm and the actual productivity gained from these technologies compared to cost.
	* *As an input becomes more expensive, firms will attempt to conserve on using that input and shift to relatively less expensive inputs*
	* Once a firm has determined the least costly production technology, it can consider the optimal scale of production, or quantity of output to produce. 
	* The **Long-run average cost (LRAC) curve** is based on an average of **short-run average cost (SRAC) curves** representing one level of fixed costs. The LRAC *shows the cost of producing each quantity in the long run*. 
	* The LRAC will be the least expensive cost curve for any level of output. 

* The LRAC shows various situations 
	* In **economies of scale**  more quantity = less cost per unit. Here *grouping economic activity is productive than spreading it out*
	* In **constant returns to scale** - the average cost of production does not change much as scale rises or falls. 
	* In **diseconomies of scale**, more quantity = more cost. This can arise from firms that are [[System Archetypes|too large]] to run efficiently.

* The LRAC also reveals something about the industry 
	* If the LRAC has a clear minima, then all firms in the industry are of the same scale.
	* If the LRAC has a flat bottom (i.e., there are alternatives to the minima), then the firms in the industry will have variable sizes. 
	* The degree to which the quantity demanded differs from the quantity produced as dictated by the LRAC determines the degree of competition 
		* If quantity demanded is less than or slightly above the minima, then there will be less competition and a monopoly will arise. 
		* *The larger the difference between quantity demanded and quantity in the minima, the more competition in the industry*

* New developments in production technology can shift the LRAC in ways that can alter the size distribution of firms in an industry.
* *Technology that increases production will drive the LRAC down*. It may also allow for more economies of scale (depending on the technology)
	* Introducing this technology will give a clearer minima (i.e., the bottom of the LRAC is more pointed). This means *firms will compete to adopt this new technology*.
	* Competition drives [[Feedback Loop|more innovation]] which then leads to more competition and more production 
## Profit 
* *All businesses try to earn a profit*
  
$$
\begin{split}
\text{Total Revenue} &= \text{Price} \ \times \text{Quantity} \\  
\text{Profit} &= \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Cost } 
\end{split}
$$
* The **average profit** is obtained using the **profit margin** of the firm [^profit_1].
  
$$
\text{average profit} = \text{price} - \text{average cost}
$$

[^profit_1]: Note that the actual definition is profit per unit produced. However, using the definition of profit and average revenue / cost, we get a simplified version in terms of profit margin. 

* *The profit-maximizing choice occurs when marginal revenue equals marginal cost*. 
* The marginal revenue may be seen as the following derivative
  
  $$
  \frac{dR}{dq} = \frac{d}{dq} \ p q   
  $$
# Externalities  
* **Externalities** pertain to the effects of a market exchange on a third party who is external to the exchange. 
* Negative externalities induce additional external costs to the firm -- in particular social costs. 
	* *If there were no social costs, the interaction between regular supply and demand will coordinate social costs and benefits.*
	* If the social costs tamper with a common pool of resources that is used for production, a [[System Archetypes|tragedy of the commons]] ensues. 
	* However, having firms pay for the social costs *has a tradeoff because firms will sell less and charge more* [^ext_1].
* Externalities can be international (for example, global warming)

[^ext_1]: This is why "green" products are more expensive -- not only due to the technology needed for mass production but also because of economic incentive.

## Negative Externalities 
* **Command-and-Control regulation** - a law that requires firms to increase their costs by counteracting pollution. There are three challenges to this 
	* It offers no incentive to improve the quality of the environment beyond the standard set. 
	* It requires the same standard for all polluters and the same pollution control technology. This does not consider the firms' ability to meet the costs. 
	* It is prone to rule bending and political manipulation. 

* **Market-oriented regulation** - a more flexible alternative to command and control regulation. 
	* **Pollution charge** - a tax imposed on the quantity of pollution the firm emits.
		* *It incentivizes reducing emissions as long as the marginal cost of doing so is less than the tax.*
		* Firms commonly face increasing costs to reduce marginal emissions since doing so requires more effort (cost). 
	* **Marketable Permits** - a permit that determines the overall quantity of allowed pollutions. It then divides a number of permits allowing only this quantity of pollution among the firms that emit the pollutant. 
		* The effect of the policy is *determined by the market behavior on selling and buying permits*.
		* The firms that find it the least expensive to reduce pollution will do so the most. 
	* **Better-Defined Property Rights** - aims to balance economic activity and pollution. 
		* **Property Rights** - legal rights of ownership on which others are not allowed to infringe without paying compensation. 

* The benefits of these laws can be categorized into the following reasons
	* People may stay healthier and live longer 
	* Certain industries that rely on a clean environment may benefit 
	* Property values may be higher 
	* People may simply enjoy a cleaner environment in a way that does not involve a market transaction. 

* *Not all regulations are a good idea. More regulation  = more cost*

* When the quantity of environmental protection is low, the marginal benefit of reducing pollution is high and the cost is low. 

## Positive Externalities 
* Positive externalities are a step towards [[Game Theory - Strategy|Pareto optimality]]. 
	* *Subsidies can be used to incentivize behavior that will lead to positive externalities.*

* Innovation can be a positive externality
	* While [[Competition between Firms#Monopolistic Competition|competition]] incentivizes innovation, it can also [[The 48 Laws of Power#7. Get Others To Do The Work For You But Always Take The Credit|punish the innovators themselves]]. 
	* *Innovation, if adopted and made widespread, generally leads to more production capabilities and economic growth. However, most innovation comes with negative externalities due to impact on the environment.*
* Intellectual Property Rights incentivize innovation by protecting the innovator. However, there are limits such as: 
	* Innovators receive payments disproportionate to the economic value of their contribution 
	* When the technology advances rapidly, the innovation can become obsolete 
	* IP rights may be granted too easily -- leading to questionably [[Doublespeak#Advertisement|new]] innovations. 
	* The time period for a patent may not cover enough period of time for the innovator to receive a good return. 
* Alternatives to IP rights exist in the form of government policy. 
	* *Government funds the research directly*. However, this uses taxpayer money (which means that citizens may be inadvertently funding something they would not want). Additionally, this is subject to politics 
	* *Give firms a tax break for R&D* depending on how much R&D they do. 
	* *Cooperative Research* to create new industries through a collaborative effort between firms. 

* *Education is a positive externality* -- a student invests in their education and (for the most part) gains private returns. At the same time, governments subsidize educational institutions and gain a productive workforce (social returns). 

## Public Goods and Common Goods 
* A **public good** is a good where private firms could not expect to receive any of the social benefit. More specifically they are:
	* **Non-exchangeable** - it is costly or impossible to exclude someone from using the good.
	* **Non-Rival** - when one person uses the public good, another can also use it. 
* *Public goods have inherent positive externalities*. 
	* However, because it is non-exchangeable and non-rival, *free-riders are incentivized to let others pay for the public good*. 
	* The trick, therefore, is for *governments to incentivize everyone to make a contribution*. 
		* Imposing taxes 
		* Some other form of "price" that is not necessarily money. For example -- advertisement space. 
		* Impose a mixture of free public use while charging for something adjacent to it to cover costs. 
		* Use social pressures 
	* *Examples:* National defense, Public Healthcare

* **Common goods** are those that are non-excludable but rivalrous. They are prone to the [[System Archetypes|tragedy of the commons]].
