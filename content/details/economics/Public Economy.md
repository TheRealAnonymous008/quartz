* **Rational Ignorance** - refraining from acquiring knowledge when the supposed cost of educating oneself on an issue exceeds the expected potential benefit that the knowledge would provide.
	* *This can be applied in the context of voting and why people tend to not be informed voters.*
	* In the context of votes, this comes from the realization that one vote does not matter. 

* Campaigns are aimed at incentivizing people to vote but at the cost of being prone to interested third parties 

* *A number of economic policies produce gains whose beneficiaries are easily identifiable, but costs that are partly or entirely shared by a large number who remain anonymous.*
	* **Special Interest Groups** are groups that are small in number relative to the nation, but quite well organized and focused on a specific issue. 
		* They can pressure legislators to enact public policies that may not be in everyone's interests.
		* *It often turns out that the regulated can exercise considerable influence over the regulators*. This follows from how the regulated have strong incentive to do so 
	* Politicians have incentive to spend government money in their home district. **Pork barrel spending** is spending that benefits a single political district. 
	* **Logrolling** is where all members of a group of legislators agree to vote for a package of otherwise unrelated laws that they individually favor

* [[Static Games of Complete Information|The median voter theory]] applies here to some extent. 

* A **voting cycle** is one where choice $A$ is preferred by the majority over choice $B$. Choice $B$ is preferred over Choice $C$ and choice $C$ is preferred over choice $A$.  *Every choice is preferred to an alternative and not preferred to another alternative*.

* *Governments can be examined like markets, except where households invest in them with taxes*. 
	* In  a democratic government, the government can enact programs, due to personal incentive or special interest groups, that are not socially beneficial for the majority. 

* *Economic Policy is apolitical because both markets and governments can produce unwanted roles.*.
