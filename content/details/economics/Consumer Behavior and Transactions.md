* *Consumers are trying to maximize utility, governed by their personal preferences, given [[Scarcity, Supply, and Demand|budget constraints]]*. 

* We can examine **Marginal Utility per unit price** as a metric for *satisfaction per price*. In this case the consumer's goal is to purchase the item with the greatest marginal utility per unit price .
	* The marginal utility calculated here is with respect to the first instance of the product bought. 
	* When maximizing this, and when exhausting the budget, the maximizing choice should occur when the marginal utility per dollar spent is the same for all goods. That is 
  
  $$
  \frac{\text{MU}_1}{\text P_1} = \frac{\text{MU}_2}{\text{P}_2} 
  $$
	* The quantity of products which which maximizes the marginal utility per quantity price is called the **consumer equilibrium**
	* The rule can be reframed differently. We can look at the ratio of prices as an indicator for how much of both goods should be bought. We have that 
	  
	  $$
	  \frac{P_1}{\text P_2} = \frac{\text{MU}_1}{\text{MU}_2} 
	  $$

* Consumer behavior can be *affected by income*
	* A change in income typically means a change in the budget constraint due to having more disposable income. 
	* *The income elasticity of demand* also affects things.
		* For normal goods, more income = more quantity of the good purchased. 
		* For inferior goods, more income = less quantity of the good purchased since better, more expensive alternatives are available.
		* An increase in income means gravitating more towards goods which have high income elasticity of demand.

* Consumer behavior can be *affected by price changes*
	* A change in price corresponds to a change in the budget constraint, typically a [[Linear Algebra|rotation effect]] ceteris paribus. 
	* The typical response to higher prices is to consume less of the good due to two effects 
		* **Substitution effect** - consumers seek a lower-price substitute to the good. 
		* **Income effect** - a higher price means that the buying power of the income decreases. 
	* However, a high price can also *affect consumption of other goods* 
		* The consumer may simply continue with their original choices for the high priced product, at the cost of cutting back on the other products. 
		* Alternatively,  the consumer may simply buy less of the high priced product and by more of the other product as a substitute. 

* The **Washington Monument Strategy** is a strategy where in making budget cuts, it proposes cutting a high utility expenditure (such as a monument). *This is a misleading strategy* since to really maximize utility, we prioritize *cut low utility expenditures first*
	* This possibly arises from the subjectivity of utility. A monument, from the perspective of national assets, is merely an attraction. However, to the people they have a (presumed) high utility due to cultural significance. 

# Information in the Market 
* Many buyers and sellers face [[Static Games of Incomplete Information|imperfect information]]. Additionally, there is some [[Information Hazards#Information Asymmetry Hazard|Information Asymmetry]] involved. 
* *Buyers and sellers, however, have incentive to counteract imperfect and asymmetric information.*
	* On the seller's side, there is [[Dynamic Games of Incomplete Information#Reputation|Reputation]] to incentivize being honest to the buyers. The following measures enhance reputation 
		* **Money-back guarantees** -  encourage people to buy something even if they may not keep it.
		* **Warranties** - a promise to replace the good for a certain time period. 
		* **Service Contract** - the buyer pays an extra amount and the seller agrees to fix anything that goes wrong (for a set time period)
		* **Occupational License** - for the [[Labor Market Theory|Labor market]] in particular. It certifies a level of quality for a person. 
		* *Rationale*: These methods attract repeat customers which are important for businesses. 
	* On the buyer's side ,there is incentive to be honest about their preferences (similar to [[Auction Theory|here]]).
		* In the labor market, there may be a trial period to see the quality of work a laborer can provide. 
		* In the [[Financial Market]], there may be requirements on having a **consigner** of the loan who repays some of the money if the borrower doe snot so. Another approach is through **collateral** which the bank can seize and sell if not paid. 
* Severe Imperfect information can thin the market and make buyers and sellers unwilling to participate
* Because of imperfect information, *buyers apply [[False Priors|heuristics]] based on the price which may mean that higher price = higher quantity demanded*
