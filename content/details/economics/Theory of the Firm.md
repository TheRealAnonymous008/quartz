* A **Firm** is a producer or business. It combines *inputs of labor, capital, land, and component materials to produce outputs* 
* A successful firm is one where the *outputs are more valuable than the inputs*. 

# Firm Structure 
## Production
* *Production requires various inputs* 
	* *Natural Resources* - the raw materials needed for making the product, as well as the land on which production will be made. 
	* *Labor* - physical and mental human effort
	* *Capital* - the physical assets that are needed to produce the product 
		* Capital is fixed in the short run.
	* *Technology* - the process for producing the product. 
	* *Entrepreneurship* - the decision making process that guides how inputs produce output. 

* Production can be summarized with a **production function**. Here $\text{TP}$ stands for total product
  $$
  \text{TP} = f(\text{NR}, L, K, t, E)
  $$
  
* The inputs of production may either be **fixed** or **variable** depending on how easy it is for them to change in a short period of time. 
	* A shorthand for the production function considers the variable inputs $L$ and fixed inputs $K$, written as $\text{TP} = f(L,K)$

* The **short term** is the period of time when some factors of production are fixed. 
	* Because capital is fixed short term. the production function in this case is of the form $\text{TP}=f(L)$. 
* In the **long term**, all factors are variable. 

* The **marginal product** is the additional output of one worker. It is with respect to labor $L$

* *Production in the short-run is characterized by the **Law of Diminishing Marginal Product***. This arises because fixed capital acts as a limiting factor.
* *Production in the long run allows convergence towards the most efficient way to produce any level of output*. This is because all production factors are variable.

## Cost
* **Cost** pertains to the expenditures paid for producing and selling the products 
	* **Explicit costs** are actual payments (i.e., wages)
	* **Implicit Costs** pertain to the [[Scarcity, Supply, and Demand|opportunity cost]] of using resources that the firm already owns, as well as the depreciation of goods.
		* *Sometimes even if more profitable opportunities exist, the implicit cost prevents firms from switching*

* **Accounting profit** pertains to explicit cash. It only considers the explicit cost. 
* **Economic profit** pertains to a measure of economic success. It considers both explicit and implicit costs. 

* For every factor of production, there is an associated **factor payment** paid for the use of said factors. 
	* **Raw Material Prices** for raw materials 
	* **Rent** for land and buildings 
	* **Wages and Salaries** for labor 
	* **Interest and Dividends** for the use of financial capital 
	* **Profit** for entrepreneurship. 

* The cost depends on how much labor and physical capital the firm uses. 
	* Costs can be fixed or variable depending on if they correspond to fixed or variable inputs. 
		* *Fixed costs do not change in the short run*
		* Fixed costs are essentially **overhead**. We can *spread the overhead* by allocating other inputs (such as labor) towards paying for them. This works since fixed costs do not change (assuming no additional capital).
	* The total cost is denoted $\text{TC}$
	* **Average Cost** is one cost metric calculated with respect to $Q$. 
	* **Marginal Cost** is another cost metric. It is with respect to quantity. 

* *Cost increases as the firm produces higher quantities of product*. In the short term this is because of diminishing marginal product.
	* Marginal cost is generally upward slowing due to diminishing returns. 
	* Low marginal costs pull down the average cost, and conversely high marginal costs pull the average cost up. 

* *The pattern of costs varies among industries and even among firms in the same industry*

## Long Term Costs 
* In the long run, firms will consider alternative **production technologies**. The choice of production technology is dependent on the needs of the firm and the actual productivity gained from these technologies compared to cost.
	* *As an input becomes more expensive, firms will attempt to conserve on using that input and shift to relatively less expensive inputs*
	* Once a firm has determined the least costly production technology, it can consider the optimal scale of production, or quantity of output to produce. 
	* The **Long-run average cost (LRAC) curve** is based on an average of **short-run average cost (SRAC) curves** representing one level of fixed costs. The LRAC *shows the cost of producing each quantity in the long run*. 
	* The LRAC will be the least expensive cost curve for any level of output. 

* The LRAC shows various situations 
	* In **economies of scale**  more quantity = less cost per unit. Here *grouping economic activity is productive than spreading it out*
	* In **constant returns to scale** - the average cost of production does not change much as scale rises or falls. 
	* In **diseconomies of scale**, more quantity = more cost. This can arise from firms that are [[System Archetypes|too large]] to run efficiently.

* The LRAC also reveals something about the industry 
	* If the LRAC has a clear minima, then all firms in the industry are of the same scale.
	* If the LRAC has a flat bottom (i.e., there are alternatives to the minima), then the firms in the industry will have variable sizes. 
	* The degree to which the quantity demanded differs from the quantity produced as dictated by the LRAC determines the degree of competition 
		* If quantity demanded is less than or slightly above the minima, then there will be less competition and a monopoly will arise. 
		* *The larger the difference between quantity demanded and quantity in the minima, the more competition in the industry*

* New developments in production technology can shift the LRAC in ways that can alter the size distribution of firms in an industry.
* *Technology that increases production will drive the LRAC down*. It may also allow for more economies of scale (depending on the technology)
	* Introducing this technology will give a clearer minima (i.e., the bottom of the LRAC is more pointed). This means *firms will compete to adopt this new technology*.
	* Competition drives [[System Dynamics#Feedback|more innovation]] which then leads to more competition and more production 
## Profit 
* *All businesses try to earn a profit*
  
$$
\begin{split}
\text{Total Revenue} &= \text{Price} \ \times \text{Quantity} \\  
\text{Profit} &= \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Cost } 
\end{split}
$$
* The **average profit** is obtained using the **profit margin** of the firm [^profit_1].
  
$$
\text{average profit} = \text{price} - \text{average cost}
$$


[^profit_1]: Note that the actual definition is profit per unit produced. However, using the definition of profit and average revenue / cost, we get a simplified version in terms of profit margin. 
# Competition 
## Perfect Competition 
* Firms are in **perfect competition** when all three of the following occur 
	* *Many firms* produce identical products 
	* *Many buyers* are available to buy the product, and *many sellers* can sell the product. 
	* Sellers and buyers have all *[[Static Games of Complete Information|information]]* to make rational decisions about the product. [^pc_1]
	* There is *free entry and exit* into and out of the market. Firms may enter or leave without restriction. 
[^pc_1]: This alone makes perfect competition an ideal since complete information is almost certainly an impossibility in the real world. 

* A **price taker** is a firm that is in perfect competition. *Market pressures force price takers to sell at equilibrium price*.  

* The product they produce will have *perfectly elastic demand* since price is fixed. 
	* Raising the price will mean consumers buy from other price takers. 
	* Lowering the price means temporary gains but eventually the rest of the market will follow and price will return to equilibrium. 

### Short Run Behavior 
![[Short Run Price Taker.png]]
<figcaption> Short Run Outcomes for Price Takers. Image from Shapiro, MacDonald and Greenlaw</figcaption>

* In the short run, firms *seek the quantity* where profits are maximized or losses are minimized

* *The profit-maximizing choice occurs when marginal revenue equals marginal cost*. 
	* Under perfect competition, the marginal revenue of a firm does not change since price does not change. *Marginal revenue is price*.  
	* The limiting factor to the quantity the firm sells is the increase in marginal cost from the Law of Diminishing Returns .
	* *An economic profit happens if and only if market price is lower than average cost*
		* The **break even point** is the point when the market price is equal to the average cost. It dictates *at least how much should be sold* to not suffer a loss. 
		* In the case that there are multiple break even points, *choose the break even point which minimizes losses*. 
* The **shutdown point** is the point in which the average variable cost and the marginal cost are equal. 
	* If the *market price is above the shutdown point*, then it is paying for both its variable costs as well as some of its fixed costs. In this case, the firm should stay in business. 
	* If the *market price is below the shutdown point*, then it will incur even more losses due to the variable losses. It should, therefore shut down. 

* *The marginal cost curve is identical to the firmâ€™s supply curve starting from the minimum point on the average variable cost curve.* This is also the curve that describes the production behavior of the firm when it is in business (i.e., not shut down)

### Long Run Behavior 
* **Entry** pertains to new firms entering the industry in response to increased industry profits 
* **Exit** pertains to firms that cease production due to losses accrued in the long run. Firms exit because they cannot consistently make money

* Entry and exit to and from the market are the driving forces behind a negative feedback loop towards an equilibrium point 
	* In the long run, *positive profits attract competition* to the market which fuels a negative feedback loop as more firms = more supply = lower market price= lower profit 
	* *Losses cause firms below the shutdown point to leave*. This fuels a negative feedback loop as less firms = less supply = higher market price = higher profit. 

	* *Equilibrium is achieved in the long run when no firm wants to enter or leave and when all firms have zero profit.*

* Industries can be categorized based on the long-run behavior based on whether their costs increase, decrease or remain constant as demand increases. 
	* **Constant Cost Industries** have highly elastic supply curves and there is a perfectly elastic supply of inputs.
	* **Increasing Cost Industries**  have inelastic supply curves and limited inputs. 
	* **Decreasing Cost Industries** typically feature some form of innovation that drives cost down
	* The **Long Run Supply (LRS)** curve is the curve formed from the long-run equilibria as supply and demand curve shift in response to an expanding market. 
		* Increasing Cost = positive sloping LRS  curve = Shortage = Higher market price    
		* Constant Cost = constant slope LRS curve = Supply meets Demand = Same market price 
		* Decreasing Cost = negative sloping LRS curve = Surplus = Lower market price 

* *Firms produce and sell goods at the lowest possible average cost*. They are productive efficient. 
* *Firms produce goods and sell them at a price equal to the social benefit of the good*. 
	* The rule for allocative efficiency is that $P=\text{MC}$ 
	* Producing less of the good means marginal costs will only decreases slightly [^pc_2]  which means $P>\text{MC}$ . In such a case, clearly *there is higher social benefit (price consumers are willing to pay) than social cost so firms will tend to produce more.* 
	* This arises *because these firms are price takers* and the price they set is equal to the price consumers are willing to pay (based on the equilibrium price). 

[^pc_2]: A sort of reverse Law of Diminishing Returns 

## Monopoly 
* A **monopoly** is a market where there is no competition. One firm produces all the output in the market. [^mon_1]
* Monopolies are **price makers** because they can set the price (although still subject to the demand curve).

[^mon_1]: In practice, it still applies if the firm has a very high market share. Although, the distinction on what constitutes a monopoly in the market depends on if we consider substitutes. 

### Barriers for Entry 
* Monopolies exploit different **barriers to entry** to prevent competitors from entering the market . 
* *A high enough barrier for entry keeps competition away* 

* **Natural Monopoly** - when economies of scale are large relative to the quantity demanded in the market 
	* Often arises when the marginal cost of adding an additional customer is very low, once fixed costs are in place. 
	* One large producer can serve the entire market more efficiently than many, smaller producers
	* It can also arise because of local markets where goods are difficult to transport .
	* The government often responds with regulation or ownership. 
* **Control of a Physical Resource** - when a company has control over a scarce physical resource. 
* **Legal Monopoly** - products where the government, themselves, prohibits or limits competition. 
	* These are typically utilities that are socially beneficial (so there is incentive to allow them to be regulated monopolies ) 
	* They are often also subject to economies of scale. 
* **Promoting Innovation** - products that are protected due to government enforced intellectual property rights. 
	* *IPs promote innovation because they guarantee that no competitor can exploit the innovation (and its associated labor costs) of a firm*. 
	* **Patent** - gives the inventor the exclusive legal right to make use of or sell the invention for a limited time. 
	* **Trademark** - an identifying symbol or name for a particular brand. 
	* **Copyright** - work that cannot be reproduced or displayed without the author's permission. 
	* **Trade Secrets** - even when a company does not have a patent on an invention, competing firms cannot steal their secrets. 
* **Intimidating Potential Competition** - tactics used by firms to discourage competitors from entering the market. 
	* **Predatory pricing** - an example of this tactic where the firm threatens to cut prices on the products so that competitors cannot make money. 
	* [[Doublespeak|Advertising]] also serves as another example 
	* Governments may or may not intervene. 

### Dynamics 
* The challenge for monopolies is to choose the price and quantity to produce to maximize profits. 
	* Because of this *a monopoly can see a negative revenue* which comes from producing too many goods that they do not sell or being forced to sell the goods at a lower price. 
* The demand curve perceived by the monopoly is the actual market demand curve for their product. 

* *A monopolist often has fairly reliable information about how changing output by small or moderate amounts will affect its marginal revenues and marginal costs*, because it has had experience with such changes over time and because modest changes are easier to extrapolate from current experience [^mon_2]
	* The general rule is still the same as that of [[#Perfect Competition]]. *The equilibrium point is when marginal revenue equals marginal cost*. 
	* The marginal revenue curve lies beneath the market demand curve since changing quantity will affect the price of all units produced prior. 

* *Monopolies are inefficient* because they do not supply enough output to be allocatively efficient 
	* They also do not produce at the minimum of the average cost curve. 
	* Monopolies are incentivized to produce less in order to charge a higher price which means $P>\text{MC}$. 
	* Compared to perfect competition, this comes because marginal revenue is not the same as the price the market is willing to pay. 
	* Monopolies are also not incentivized to innovate since they are the only suppliers of the product.
