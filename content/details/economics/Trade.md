* The **level of trade** is the amount of exports of goods and services as a percentage of the GDP. 
	* It measures how much of the country's production it exports. *It is also a measure of the country's engagement with the global market.*
	* It is influenced by (1) the size of the economy; (2) the [[Geography]]; and (3) the history of trade.
	* *It is distinct from the balance of trade.*

* The **balance of trade** is any gap between the monetary value of exports with imports.
	* **Merchandise trade balance** - trade balance  tracked by the physical items transported between countries. This is outdated due to services exported by technology. 
* **Current Account Balance** - includes other international flows of income and foreign aid on top of balance of trade. 
	* A *current account deficit* implies the country is a net borrower from abroad. 
	* A *current account surplus* implies that the country is a net lender to the rest of the world. 
* From an economist's perspective,  *A balance trade is a balance of payments*
	* A trade deficit means the same thing as an inflow of financial capital.
	* Conversely, a trade surplus means the same thing as an outflow of financial capital. 

* The **national saving and investment identity** is an equation showing the relation between money spent and money saved by an [[Financial Market|economy]]. 
  $$
  \text{Supply of financial capital}= \text{Demand for financial capital}
  $$

	* Domestic saving swill always appear as part of the supply of financial capital 
	* Domestic investment will always appear as part of the demand for financial capital. 
	* Government investment and trade balance can move from either supply or demand for as long as the identity is established. 
	* A nation's own levels of domestic saving and investment determine a nation’s balance of trade 

* The equation can be rewritten as follows 
  $$
  S + (M-X) = I + (G-T)
  $$
	* $S$ - private savings 
	* $M$ - imports 
	* $X$ - exports
	* $I$ - private investments 
	* $T$ - taxes 
	* $G$ - government spending

* *Consider the short-run effects of the economy on trade imbalance*
	* In most cases, *A recession tends (to make a trade deficit smaller or a trade surplus larger.* The trade surplus is due to domestic prices being lower than foreign prices  
	* In most cases, *Strong economic growth tends to make a trade deficit larger or a trade surplus smaller.* The deficit is due to foreign prices being lower than domestic prices which attracts foreign investors.

* Trade imbalance does not necessarily imply a successful economy nor does it imply an unsuccessful economy.
	* Trade deficits can be good if used to invest in jumpstarting infrastructure and sectors that boost productivity. 

* *Large trade surpluses or deficits can become an issues (i.e., recessions)*.
	* Running large deficits is bad when the country does not invest the incoming funds towards improving productivity. 
	* When money rapidly flows in due to borrowing but at the same time rapidly flows out, the country may plunge into recession. 
	* Trade surpluses may mean that financial capital is being "drained" out of the country, or that there is not enough investment within the country for the capital to go towards. 
	* Countries that have trade imbalances are more vulnerable in the financial crisis since they are reliant on global supply (importers) and demand (exporters). 

* *The fundamental economic question is not whether a nation’s economy is borrowing or lending at all, but whether the particular borrowing or lending in the particular economic conditions of that country makes sense.*

# International Trade
* *International Trade tends to accompany economic growth*. 
* A country has an **absolute advantage** over another country in producing a good if it uses fewer resources to produce that good. This is influenced primarily by [[Geography|Geographical factors]]
* *Trade occurs due to [[Scarcity, Supply, and Demand|comparative advantage]]* which means countries can produce a good at a lower cost relative to other goods.
	* *Gains from trade* happen when the trading price for a good (in terms of another good) is greater than the opportunity cost of obtaining that good through production. 
	* Like firms, *if each country specializes in its comparative advantage, it will benefit from trade, and total global output will increase*

* Even when one country has an absolute advantage in all products, trade can still benefit both sides due to minimizing costs via specialization.
* *Trade allows each country to take advantage of lower opportunity costs in the other country*

* A high proportion of trade is **intra-industry trade** -- the trade of goods within the same industry from one country to another. 
	* In developing specific products, firms in certain countries develop unique and different skills and *focus on refining the processes in one specific part of the value chain.* 
	* *There is a trend in international trade of splitting up the value chain*. This is due to easier infrastructure for information sharing and transportation.
	* Intra-industry trade also *facilitates [[Firms, Production and Externalities|economies of scale]] which drives down production costs. 
	* It also facilitates [[Competition between Firms|competition]] which drives innovation and promotes market variety.

* *Countries are not destined to have the same comparative advantage forever*, but must instead be flexible in response to ongoing changes in comparative advantage.

* **Tariff** - taxes that governments place on imported goods. 
	* Traditionally ,this is used to protect local industry.
	* Low-income countries benefit more from trade than high-income countries do.
