* The **nominal values** of any economic statistic are based on actual prices. The **real value** is the same statistic adjusted for inflation.
	* If inflation is significant, we should pay attention to the real value more. Otherwise, nominal income becomes more crucial, especially in the case of deflation.
	* A **price index** is the normalized weighted average of price relatives for goods during an interval of time. Typically it is reported as a percentage
	* $\text{Real} = \frac{\text{Normal}}{\text{Price Index}}$
* The **trade balance** is the gap between the value of exports and imports. A country has a **trade surplus** if it exports more than it import. The country has a **trade deficit** if it imports more than it exports. 
* The trade balance is calculated using imports $M$ and exports $X$
  
  $$
  \text{Trade Balance} = X - M
  $$

* The **Gross Domestic Product** - is the value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given year.. It does not take into account who owns the means of production.
* GDP can be measured in a few ways 
	* The total monetary value *consumers purchase* in the economy; In this case, GDP is equal to the following 
	  
	$$
	\text{GPP} = \text{Consumption} + \text{Investment in Capital}+ \text{Government Spending} + \text{Trade Balance}
	$$ 
	* The total monetary value *producers make* in the economy; We exclude intermediate goods from the count and only count **final goods and services** which are directly sold for consumption, investment, government, and trade. 
	  $$
	  \text{GDP} = \text{total revenue of all final goods} -  \text{total costs of all final goods}
	  $$

	* The total *national income*
	  
	  $$
	  \text{GDP} = \text{Wages} + \text{Firm Profits} + \text{Rental rate on Capital}
	  $$


* A **recession** is a significant decline in real GDP. A **depression** is a lengthy and deep recession.
	* Recessions are associated with unemployment as firms cut costs and slow down production

* **GDP Per Capita** is a way of comparing the GDPs of two economies, accounting for the populations of each economy 
  
  $$
  \text{GDP per capita} = \frac{\text{GDP}}{\text{population}}
  $$
	* *GDP Per Capita only gives a rough idea on the differences in standards of living across countries.* However, higher GDP per capita = better standards of living = higher income.
	* GDP per capita does not address issues of [[Labor Market Theory#Labor Issues|income inequality]].
* *GDP is limited as a measure of quality of life* 
	* It doesn't capture unpaid work or leisure time
	* It doesn't account for quality of living as a result of the government's expenditures 
	* It doesn't account for innovation and its effects.
	* It doesn't account for unforeseen disasters and could even see these as a "good" thing because of a spike in economic performance.
	* It doesn't account for the actual social welfare of goods that are being sold.

* The **Gross National Product** is the total value of all the final products and services turned out by means of production owned by the country's residents. We can count foreign assets for as long as they are owned by a national resident.
  
  $$
  \begin{split}
  Z&:= \text{net income of domestic citizens in foreign lands}\\
  Y&:= \text{net income of foreigners in domestic territory}\\
  \text{GNP} &= \text{GDP} + Z - Y\\
  \end{split}
  $$

* **Net National Product** - the GNP less how much physical capital is worn out because of aging via depreciation. 
  
  $$
  \text{NNP} = \text{GNP} - \text{total physical capital depreciated}
  $$
