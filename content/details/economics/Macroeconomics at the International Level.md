* *The various economies that comprise the global economy are diverse.* This can be [[Macroeconomic Quantities|quantified]] using GDP per capita. The diversity is due to a variety of reasons 
	* [[Geography|Geographical]] differences 
	* Differences in demography -- most low-income countries are skewed towards young people. 
	* Differences in Industry Structure 
	* Differences in Economic Institutions (i.e., free market vs command economy). 

# Meeting Macroeconomic Goals 
* *No nation intentionally aims for a low standard of living*, high rates of [[Macroeconomic Goals|unemployment and inflation]], or an unsustainable [[Trade|trade]] imbalance. *However, nations will differ in their priorities* and in the situations in which they find themselves, and so their policy choices can reasonably vary, too

## Economic Growth 
* For *High income economies*, the challenge of economic growth comes in innovation and shifting aggregate supply to the right. 
	* This entails [[Macroeconomic Policy#Fiscal Policy|Fiscal policy]] focused on investment, and Monetary policy to keep inflation low. 
	* These countries run expansionary monetary policies. 
* For *Middle-Income economies*, the challenge comes in domestic savings, investments in human capital, technological R&D, and engaging with the world market. 
	* In many of these countries, the government heavily regulates the financial sector and various industries. 
* For *Low-Income economies*, they face extreme poverty and unemployment. 
	* The main challenge is in establishing a stable economy with a stable legal backing. There is also a need to establish appropriate market forces.
	* The main obstacle is often political. 
	* They must also cross a threshold of productivity considering income is invested into needs rather than capital that can boost productivity further. 
	* *Foreign aid does not necessarily work as it may only provide short-term benefits and may be politically motivated*. 

## Unemployment 
* For *High-Income economies*, the challenge is either the cyclical unemployment during a recession or the natural rate of unemployment. 
	* Solutions lie in either expansionary monetary policy or in automatic stabilizers. However, these are not perfect solutions due to time lag and the need to re-establish trust that the economy is growing. 
	* Policies regarding the [[Labor Market Theory|Labor Market]] could reduce the natural rate of unemployment, but this might also result in firms hiring less. 

* For *Low and Middle-Income economies*, the problem of unemployment also extends to unstable jobs that has variable payoff. 
	* These workers are also not subject to worker's benefits and so are subject to harsh working conditions. 
	* Another challenge is *transitioning of labor*. There is incentive towards manufacturing which requires low skilled workers and which pays a low but consistent wage. 
	* The period of economic transition may cause the agricultural sector to suffer. 

## Inflation 
* *High-Income economies* operate on the following principles regarding inflation [^inf_1]
	* Monetary policy can prevent inflation from being entrenched in the economy in the medium and long term. 
	* There is no long-run gain to letting inflation become established. 

* *Low and Middle-Income economies* lack both the tools for addressing inflation and the consensus among policy makers that this is an appropriate goal 
	* Inflation in these countries come from large budget deficits. *Too much money chasing too few goods*. 
	* For other countries, especially those with **converging economies**, they can catch up to technology leaders at the cost of inflation rates that are "high" for high-income economies. 
[^inf_1]: There is often a political consensus in these economies that these are the appropriate goals with regards to inflation. 

## Trade 
* Low and Middle-Income economies previously shunned the idea of being open to international trade. However, *evidence from successful economies that have "broken through" suggests that world trade is an imperative goal*. No country exists that is isolated yet has a high standard of living 

* There are *concerns over foreign trade* namely job loss, negative externalities to the environment, and unfair labor practices.. 
* **Infant Industry Argument** - subsidizing or protecting new industries for a time until they become established is good. [^trade_1]
	* A country should block imports for a limited time to give infant industries time to mature and compete with other industries in the global market. 
* There are *concerns over international flows of capital*. In particular, there may be trade imbalances. 
	* High-income economies tend to run trade surpluses 
	* Middle and low income economies tend to run trade deficits. 
* *Trade imbalances may not be sustainable in the long run* which  could mean budget deficits or sudden bursts of inflation as aggregate supply shifts left. 
* *Over-reliance on imports raises questions* since this may make the country prone to bad loans and they may be stuck in debt to lenders of financial capital, which may lead to bankruptcy and recessions. 
	* The challenge is in *creating economic policy that can control or reduce foreign flows of capital*. 

[^trade_1]: This is controversial since it falls under whether or not a country should adopt protectionist policies in the face of the global market. 
# Globalization 
* **Protectionism** - seeks to shield domestic producers from foreign competition. It manifests in three forms. 
	* Tariffs. 
	* **Import Quotas** - limitations in the quantity of products imported 
	* **Nontariff barriers** - all other ways that a nation can draw up rules, regulations, inspections, and paperwork to make it more costly to import product.

* *Protectionism is a matter of choosing between maximizing producer surplus or consumer surplus*.

## Arguments for Protectionism 
* *Globalization can threaten national interests and security*. 
	* *Trade policies can contribute to poverty in low-income countries* because there is incentive for production in these countries to produce more at the expense of the laborers. High income countries can also drive out local businesses.
	* International trade can lead to fewer jobs, lower wages, or poor working conditions
	*  In particular, *globalization may disproportionately impose costs on low skilled low income workers* because 
		* They must compete with imported goods from trade 
		* There is no incentive for their wages to rise since "labor is cheap abroad".
		* They do not immediately benefit from physical capital. 
	* It would also be bad for a nation to depend on imports for key products. 

* The Infant Industry Argument (see [[#Trade|here]]) applies. However, in order to hand it out properly: [^prot_1] 
	* Do not hand out protectionism and other subsidies to all industries, but focus on a few industries where your country has a realistic chance to be a world-class producer.
	* Do not use protectionist policies in industries that other industries rely on (i.e., tech). This imposes more costs on other industries. 
	* Have clear guidelines for when the infant industry policy will end.

[^prot_1]: This is from the World Bank. In practice this is subject to politics 

* The **Anti-Dumping Argument** means we block imports that are sold below the cost of production by imposing tariffs (the practice of selling goods below their cost of production is **dumping**). 
	* *Dumping cases are countercyclical*. They increase during recessions and decrease during economic booms. 
	* Dumping occurs either because of [[Scarcity, Supply, and Demand|market forces which shift demand]] or because of strategizing in a similar manner to [[Competition between Firms#Monopoly|predatory pricing]]. Lower cost = More demand that can drive out local industry. 

* *Globalization affects the environment* in a negative manner to the point that the social costs outweigh the social benefits. There is a gap between the environmental  standards of high income and low income countries 
	* The **race to the bottom [[System Archetypes|scenario]]**  goes as follows: 
		* Profit seeking firms shift production abroad where environmental standards are lower
		* The shift in production means low income countries are incentivized to keep environmental standards low 
		* Profit seeking firms continue to do this and environmental laws race to the bottom. 
	* *Blocking imports may allow low income countries to raise their environmental standards*. 

* The **Unsafe Consumer Products Argument** means that certain imported products are unsafe for consumers. For as long as the reason is founded in scientific evidence, this argument applies. 

## Arguments Against Protectionism 
* When a country sets a low or medium tariff or import quota, the equilibrium price and quantity will be somewhere between those that prevail with no trade and those with completely free trade.
	* *Protectionism benefits local producers but imposes costs on local consumers* since less of the good will be available, and the good will be sold at a higher price than if trade were allowed.
	* Protectionism may also protect some jobs but not others as costs are higher. *It reshuffles jobs from industries without import protections to those that are protected from imports*. However, this does not make new jobs,
	* Protectionism results in *deadweight loss* due to lost economic efficiency. 
	* The key is how flexible workers are in finding jobs in different industries. The effect of trade on low-wage workers *depends considerably on the structure of labor markets* and indirect effects felt in other parts of the economy 

* While *eliminating trade barriers* in one sector of the economy will likely result in some job loss in that sector, consumers will spend the resulting savings in other sectors of the economy and hence *increase the number of jobs in those other sectors.*
	* Promoting trade will also increase social surplus in both parties involved.
	* *Trade will raise the average wages in the economy* since workers operate on their comparative advantage. Trade barriers have the opposite effect.

* The Infant Industry Argument holds in theory, but in practice protectionist policy in place has restricted the industry too much that it could not compete with the global market. 
* *Anti-Dumping is difficult to find evidence for*, and often it is founded in politics rather than economic principles. 
* *Environmental Costs to Trade may not be that big in practice*
	* In the race to the bottom scenario, lax environmental laws are not the only factor for shifting production. Environmental costs, as well, are only a small fraction of total cost for starting up. 
	* Even if the reason for moving production to foreign countries is environmentally motivated, *the industry design will still follow the design in high-income (high environmental standard) countries.* This applies unless the firm is willing to redesign its industry structure. 
	* Firms are incentivized to follow high environmental standards since the cost of doing otherwise outweighs the benefits. 
	* *Protectionism is not the only approach to incentivizing environmental standards*. For example, [[Macroeconomic Policy#Taxes and National Debt|Taxes]] on pollution and emissions. 
* It makes little sense to block imports for key economic goods since doing so only restricts possible sources of these goods. 
* Products that are of "national interest" tend to be arbitrarily defined, usually motivated by politics. 

## Trade Policy 
* The **General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade** was signed to provide a forum where nations could negotiate trade restrictions. This would eventually become the **World Trade Organization**.
	* Negotiations on this level tend to be slow. 
	* *The general trend worldwide appears to be lower barriers of trade*. 

* **Free Trade Agreement** - participants allow each other imports without tariffs or quotas 
* **Common Markets** - participants have a common external trade policy as well as free trade within the group 
* **Economic Unions** - participants have a common market as well as coordinated monetary and fiscal policy. 
* *Regional Trade Agreements may conflict with the goals of the WTO* since they may limit trade from anywhere else. 

* On a national level, *there is conflict between national protectionist laws, and international free trade agreements*. This conflict is rooted in only allowing some imports -- specifically those that benefit national interests.

* Trade benefits the average person, but not the "below average" person -- producers who fail to compete with the global market, and consumers who cannot buy from the global market 
	* *However, it is better to embrace the gains from trade and deal with the costs with other policy tools, than it is to cut off trade to avoid both costs and benefits*

* *Trade can be viewed as a disruptive force on the economy*.
