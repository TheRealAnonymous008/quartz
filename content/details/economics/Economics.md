* **Economics** is the study of how human make decisions in the face of scarcity. **Scarcity** means that wants exceed available resources.
* The **division of labor** means that the way one produces a good or service is divided into a number of tasks that different workers perform rather than one person doing al the tasks.
	* *Division of labor counters scarcity*. 
	* *Division of labor increases production* for three reasons [^1]
		* **Specialization** of workers on tasks they are well suited for, which makes them more effective.
		* Specialization leads to a [[System Dynamics|feedback loop]] where workers learn to produce more quickly and with higher quality. This also leads to **innovation**.
		* Specialization takes advantage of **economies of scale** where as production increases, the average cost of production for each individual unit decreases. 
	* *This necessitates trade* because each individual specializes and must exchange their services for other needs that they are unable to produce.

* A simple economic model is the **Circular Flow Model**

* Economies can be organized into different ways.
	* **Traditional** - what you produce is what you consume. It is driven by tradition and there is little economic progress or development
	* **Command** - economic effort is devoted to goals passed down from the government, which dictates what gets produced and what gets consumed. 
	* **Markets** - decision making is decentralized and is based on **markets** -- institutions that bring buyers and sellers together. 
		* Private enterprises own and operate production based on supply and demand. 
		* Income is based on the ability to convert resources into something socially beneficial. 
		* Market-oriented economies have fewer regulations, often just enough to facilitate fair trade. 
		* Markets allocate goods to the people who value them the most, under the assumption that the value of the good is easily understood by all market participants. 
	* **Underground / Black Market** - often present in heavily regulated economies. This market is unregulated.
