* **Economics** is the study of how human make decisions in the face of scarcity. **Scarcity** means that wants exceed available resources.
* The **division of labor** means that the way one produces a good or service is divided into a number of tasks that different workers perform rather than one person doing al the tasks.
	* *Division of labor counters scarcity*. 
	* *Division of labor increases production* for three reasons [^1]
		* **Specialization** of workers on tasks they are well suited for, which makes them more effective.
		* Specialization leads to a [[System Dynamics|feedback loop]] where workers learn to produce more quickly and with higher quality. This also leads to **innovation**.
		* Specialization takes advantage of **economies of scale** where as production increases, the average cost of production for each individual unit decreases.

* Economics teaches you [[Philosophy|how to think not what to think]] [^2]
