* **Labor market** - the market for employers (consumers) and job seekers (producers)
# Supply and Demand 
* Price now refers to  salaries and wages. 
* Quantity refers to the quantity of labor that is demanded.

* *Shifts in labor demand can occur for a variety of reasons*
	* More demand for the good produced = more demand for labor to match production needs 
	* More education  = more demand from a productive labor pool. 
	* Technologies that act as substitutes = less demand for labor 
	* Technologies that act as complements = more demand for labor. 
	* Better technology = increased demand for skilled workers who can use the technology 
	* More companies producing a product = more demand for employees who can produce that product. 
	* Government regulation can increase or decrease demand for labor. 
	* Higher prices and costs for additional production inputs = lower demand for labor to balance costs and revenues. 
	* Lower prices and costs for additional production inputs = higher demand for labor to increase productivity. 

* *Shifts and labor supply can be affected by various factors.*
	* More workers = more supply . 
	* Higher standards required by employers = lower supply 
	* Government policies can increase or decrease labor supply.

* *Minimum wage acts as a price floor*.
