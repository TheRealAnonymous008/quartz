* **Labor market** - the market for employers (consumers) and job seekers (producers)
# Supply and Demand 
* Price now refers to  salaries and wages. 
* Quantity refers to the quantity of labor that is demanded.

* *Shifts in labor demand can occur for a variety of reasons*
	* More demand for the good produced = more demand for labor to match production needs 
	* More education  = more demand from a productive labor pool. 
	* Technologies that act as substitutes = less demand for labor 
	* Technologies that act as complements = more demand for labor. 
	* Better technology = increased demand for skilled workers who can use the technology 
	* More companies producing a product = more demand for employees who can produce that product. 
	* Government regulation can increase or decrease demand for labor. 
	* Higher prices and costs for additional production inputs = lower demand for labor to balance costs and revenues. 
	* Lower prices and costs for additional production inputs = higher demand for labor to increase productivity. 

* *Shifts and labor supply can be affected by various factors.*
	* More workers = more supply . 
	* Higher standards required by employers = lower supply 
	* Government policies can increase or decrease labor supply.

* *Imperfect labor markets arise due to either the employers or the employees*
# Labor Market Competition
* **The First Rule of Labor Markets** - If a firm want to maximize profits, it will never pay more (in terms of wages and benefits) for a worker than the value of their marginal productivity to the firm .
* The demand for labor is defined as the marginal product of labor (in products per hour) times the value of that output to the firms 
	* *The demand for labor is dependent on the marginal revenue*. In particular the quantity of labor $Q_L$ demanded is given by 
	  
	  $$
	  Q_L = \frac{d P}{dL} \times \frac{dR}{dQ}
	  $$
	* In a [[Competition between Firms#Perfect Competition|perfectly competitive]] labor market, firms can hire all the labor they want up to when market wage equals the demand for labor. 
	* If the market is imperfectly competitive, employment will be lower because the demand for labor is lower. 

## Monopsony
* *Laborers have the disadvantage in the labor market* since they have need employment more than the employer needs them.  
* A **monopsony** is an employer exploiting its market power wherein it has no competition in hiring so it can offer lower wages. 
	* However, monopsonies are subject to the supply curve of labor. They must raise the wage they pay not just for new workers but for all existing workers at the previous lower wage. *The marginal cost of hiring additional labor is greater than the wage and it is above the market supply of labor.*
	* A monopsony will hire up until the demand for labor equals the marginal cost of additional labor. 
	* *Despite the incentive to lower wages, a monopsony will behave qualitatively similar to that of a perfectly competitive labor market due to market pressures (though monopsonies will hire less workers and pay lower wages).* 


## Labor Unions 
* *Labor unions function like monopolies in a labor market* because they require employers to deal with workers collectively and it acts as a single source of labor.
	* Unions, assuming a market where they are the only source of laborers, can threaten that firms should pay higher wages, *above what the equilibrium wage would be otherwise, and more workers than what a firm would have been willing to hire at that price*. 
		* Some unions have opposed firms using physical capital to get around unionized labor since this also reduces labor.
		* Other unions have also advocated for labor-saving technologies, typically for reasons of safety but also productivity since better capital = more productivity. 
	* From the perspective of the firm, *unionized labor must offer higher productivity*. 
		* If there is higher productivity, firms can afford to pay for the unionized labor and demand shifts accordingly. 
		* Otherwise, the firm incurs losses.
		* Firms may also end up using more physical capital and less labor.

* Proponents of labor unions contend that it protects worker rights
* Critics of labor unions contend that it only benefits the workers short term but in the long term, without labor firms will close and leave no employers .

* Some explanations for declining union membership [^union_1]
	* Shift in demand for labor in markets that are not covered by the union.
	* Globalization and competition from foreign producers 
	* Redundancy due to workplace protection laws 
	* Legal and Cultural reasons that make it difficult for unions to organize workers and expand their membership. 

[^union_1]: Applies specifically to US context in Shapiro, MacDonald and Greenlaw, but could be seen as general reasons as well. The most plausible reason is legality. 

## Bilateral Monopoly 
* A situation where a monopsony meets a labor union. 
* There will be less employment due to competing demands from both sides. 
* The exact wage will depend on on which party has the bigger bargaining power. 
	* If it's the monopsonist, there will be lower wages 
	* If it's the labor union, there will be higher wages .

# Labor Issues 
* Some common protections come in the form of labor laws 
	* Minimum hourly wages. *Minimum wage acts as a price floor*. 
	* Maximum hours of work before overtime rates 
	* Child labor prohibitions  
	* Occupational Health and Safety conditions in the workplace 
	* Preventing discrimination 
	* Providing family leave 
	* Requiring advance notice of layoffs 
	* Covering workers with unemployment insurance 
	* Setting a limit on the number of immigrant workers form  other countries 

## Discrimination 
* Discrimination can prevent laborers from making productive and meaningful contributions due to barriers of entry. 
* It is often the case that minorities are explicitly paid less even when they have equal skill and expertise as other workers. 
* However, note that not every inequity is due to overt discrimination from the employers. It could simply be that minorities do not have the skills and expertise needed as a result of inequitable education, segregation and other subtle forms of discrimination.
* Circumstance also plays a role -- for example, mothers who have to leave to take care of their children. 

* *While competitive markets can allow some employers to practice discrimination, it can also provide profit-seeking firms with incentives not to discriminate* Still, economic forces are not enough to completely eliminate discrimination. 

* *Public policy can make discrimination illegal*. However these approaches may not approach [[System Opportunities|systemic]] issues.
	* **Affirmative action** - efforts by government or businesses to give special rights to minorities in hiring and promotion to make up for past discrimination. 

## Immigration 
* In the ideal case, immigration is simply seen as an increase in population. 
* In the typical case, immigrants are at a disadvantage since they do not have the credentials.

* *Immigration can disrupt certain markets*.
	* Due to lacking credentials, immigrants are commonly in unskilled labor, which threatens the domestic labor market for unskilled labor .
	* Immigrants can also contribute to the increased demand for local goods and services. 
	* Immigrants impose costs due to state-run programs without paying as much in terms of taxes. Effectively, immigrants are an investment that taxpayers may not want.

* *In the long term, immigration has more social benefits than social costs*. 

## Poverty 
* **Poverty** arises from people falling below the **poverty line** -- the income one needs for a basic standard of living.  
* *Certain demographics are less prone to poverty than others*. [[#Discrimination|Segregation plays a part in this.]]

* The **poverty trap** is a situation where incentivizing the impoverished to work also reduces the amount of government support they receive. Effectively a reverse form of [[System Archetypes|success to the successful]].

## Income Inequality 
* **Income inequality** compares the share of the total income in society that different groups receive.
