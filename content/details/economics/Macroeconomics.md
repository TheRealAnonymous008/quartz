* *Macroeconomics aims to study three things* -- the *goals* of an economy in terms of economic growth, unemployment, and inflation; *frameworks* for analyzing the economy, and *policies* for influencing the economy.
* *Macro-economic quantities should not focus solely on maximizing GDP* 
* Much of Macroeconomics has a political dimension. This is especially apparent with regards to policies to address macroeconomic goals.
