* In modern day economics, (fiat) money is valued because of society's shared trust and agreement that it has value and can be used for transaction
* The quantity of money in an economy is closely linked to the quantity of lending or credit in the economy
# Monetary Systems 
* Economies without money operate on a **barter** system
	* *Bartering is inefficient for coordinating trade*. 
	* Bartering entails a double coincidence of wants where both parties must have something the other wants. 
	* Bartering does not allow us to easily enter into future contracts 
	* It does not allow for an economy to grow because people will have to interact with the complex system of bartering for goods. 
* *Money fulfills several functions in the economy*
	* It is a *medium of exchange* that acts as an intermediary between buyer and seller as both accept money as payment.
	* It is a *store of value* because it is non-perishable and it retains its value as money.
	* It is a *unit of account* which serves as a way to measure the value of goods and services.  It simplifies evaluating transactions. 
	* It is a *standard of deferred payment* which makes it acceptable to have transactions where the buyer pays in the future. 
* **Commodity Money** pertains to things which act as money but also as things with value or utility beyond being money.
* **Commodity-backed Currency** pertains to currency backed up by commodities held at a bank.
* **Fiat Money** - money that has no intrinsic value beyond being an accepted standard by all involved parties for use as legal tender.

* **Liquidity** - refers to how quickly a financial asset can be used to buy a good or service. 
	* The **M1 Money Supply** includes monies that are very liquid
		* Cash including all currency in circulation.
		* *Checkable Deposits* - amounts held in checking accounts and where the bank can give money on demand  
		* *Savings Deposits* - bank accounts from which money can be withdrawn at an ATM rather than through check.
	* The **M2 Money Supply** includes M1 plus monies that are less liquid 
		* *Money market funds* - pools of deposits from many investors. 
		* *Time Deposits* - accounts that the depositor has committed to leaving in the bank for a certain period of time in exchange for high interest. 

* A **debit card** is an instruction to the user's bank to transfer money directly and immediately from the bank account to the seller. 
* A **credit card** is an instruction to transfer money directly from the credit card company to the seller but where the buyer is treated as "borrowing" money from the credit card company.
* A **smart card** is used to store a certain value of money on the card and use it to make purchases.
# Banks 
* *Banks act as financial intermediaries* from which people can store money in an account so that they no longer have to carry all the cash on hand.
	* A **financial intermediary** is an institution (typically a bank) that operates between a saver who deposits funds in a bank and a borrower who receives a loan from that bank. 
	* All the money in the bank from all its savers are pooled together, and it is from this pool that the bank takes from to lend.
* Banks lower transaction costs since people can go directly to the bank for cash. 

## Bank Capital
* A **balance sheet** lists assets and liabilities. **Assets** are things owned and used to produce something; **Liabilities** are things owed and considered debt. 
* **Net Worth** is calculated as the total value of Assets minus the total value Liabilities. A positive net worth is indicative of a healthy business. A negative net worth means the business is bankrupt.
  
  $$
  \text{Net Worth} = \text{Total Assets} - \text{Total Liabilities}
  $$

* The **bank capital** is the bank's net worth. 
	* Deposits are viewed as liabilities from the perspective of the bank since the bank is borrowing the saver's money
	* Withdrawals are viewed as assets from the perspective of the bank since the bank is lending money to the borrower.
* The **primary loan market** is the market where financial institutions make loans to borrowers 
* The **secondary loan market** is the market where financial institutions buy and sell loans.

* *Banks can go bankrupt when the number of loan defaults (loans unpaid) is greater than expected*. [^bank_1]
	* This is especially apparent due to **asset-liability time mismatch**. Borrowers can withdraw money quickly (short term) but many of the bank's assets will only be repaid over years (long term)
	* Like in the [[Financial Market]], banks can diversify its loans. However, this will not help during a recession that touches many sectors.

[^bank_1]: For example, during a [[Macroeconomic Goals|recession]].

* The willingness of the bank to give a loan is dependent on the riskiness of the loan (higher risk = lower likelihood of paying to acquire the loan. 
* Another factor is interest rate. Higher interest rate relative to market rates = higher likelihood of paying to acquire the loan. 
* *Aside from bank loans, a bank has bonds and reserves that act as assets*. 

* *Banks make money through loans*. In particular, if there are multiple banks, they are only required to hold a fraction of their deposits as reserves. The loan of one bank can then become deposits other banks which *increases the money supply*
* The **money multiplier formula** says how many rounds of lending in a banking system there are.
  
$$
\text{Money Multiplier} = \frac{1}{\text{Reserve Requirement}}
$$
* The total change in the M1 money supply (and the amount made by the bank) are given us 
  $$
  \text{Total Change} = \text{Money Multiplier} \times \text{Excess Requirement}
  $$
* *Banks make money by allowing money to circulate*.
