# Monetary Policy 
## Banks 
* These are policies concerned with [[Money|banking systems]].
* The **central bank** is the organization responsible for
	* Conducting monetary policy
	* Promoting the stability of the [[Financial Market|financial system]]
	* Providing banking services to commercial banks and other depository institutions and to the federal government
	* Ensuring that there is enough currency circulating through the financial system to meet public demand.
	* Assuring that banks are in compliance with consumer protection laws.

* *Bank regulation is intended to maintain banks' solvency by avoiding excessive risk.* Regulation can come as: 
	* Requirements of minimum reserve
	* Restrictions on the types of investments they are allowed to make 
	* Requirements to maintain minimum bank capital.
* The government can also conduct inspections if the banks are following regulations. Banks that have low net worth or are engaging in risky behavior can be required to change behavior or be forced to close. 
* There are issues with measuring the net worth of a bank as it is contingent on whether or not borrowers can repay their loans. There are also political issues to consider. 
* **Bank Runs** - situations wherein people *race to withdraw their deposits after realizing that the bank is failing*. 
	* The race arises because the sooner one can withdraw their money, the more likely the bank is to be able to repay them. 
	* Bank runs can cascade and [[System Archetypes|escalate]] since more withdrawal = lower bank net worth = more fear = more withdrawal. This can spread to other solvent banks as well. 
	* There are two strategies against bank runs 
		* **Deposit insurance** - an insurance system to make sure depositors do not lose their money even if the bank goes bankrupt.
		* **Lender of Last Resort** - the central bank lends to banks and other financial institutions when they cannot obtain funds from anywhere else. This also reassures customers that they will not lose their money. 

## Aggregate Demand 
* *Monetary Policy influences aggregate demand with the goal of influencing macroeconomic outcomes by proxy*.

* *Central Banks can implement monetary policy in three different ways* 
	* *Open market operations* - the central bank buys or sells treasury bonds to influence the quantity of bank reserves and the interest rates. 
	* *Change discount rate* - If the central bank raises the discount rate, then commercial banks will reduce their borrowing of reserve and instead loan to replace their reserve. Fewer loans available means market interest rate rises. 
		* Compared to open market operations, changing the discount rate is less effective 
	* *Change reserve requirements* - the central bank raises or lowers reserve requirements. If the central bank raises the discount rate, then commercial banks will reduce their borrowing of reserves

* **Expansionary Monetary Policy** is one which lowers interest rates and stimulates borrowing 
* **Contractionary Monetary Policy** is one which raises interest rates and reduces borrowing.
* Both expansionary and contractionary monetary policy will shift the aggregate demand. 
	* Contractionary policy reduces investments which lowers the quantity of aggregate demand. 
	* Expansionary policy increases aggregate demand and can help in the case of a recession or high unemployment. 
* Monetary policy can push the entire spectrum of interest rates higher or lower, but the forces of supply and demand in those specific markets for lending and borrowing set the specific interest rates.
* *Monetary policy should be countercyclical* -- it should act to counterbalance business cycles. 

* **Quantitative Easing** - involves the purchase of long term government and private mortgage-backed securities by the central bank to make credit available to stimulate aggregate demand. 

## Pitfalls 
* *Monetary policy is subject to time lags* Thus, it has no effect on the immediate future 
* When many banks are choosing to hold excess reserves, expansionary monetary policy may not work well. This comes as an *incongruence between banks' concerns of a recession and the central bank's desire to stimulate demand*
* Unpredictable Movements in Velocity mean that trying to change the money supply becomes difficult as the effect of doing so to the nominal GDP becomes less predictable. 
* *Monetary policy tends to be neoclassical* -- it is more concerned with inflation than unemployment.  This leads to **inflation targeting** where the central bank is legally required to focus on keeping inflation low
* *Monetary policy might overlook asset bubbles and leverage cycles*. 
	* Leverage cycles arise when good economic times mean more borrowing which exaggerates economic growth to unsustainable levels to the point banks are no longer willing to lend and loans become too expensive to pay off which leads to economic downturn. 


# Fiscal Policy 
# Others 
* *Tax cuts make sense when unemployment is high*. This can serve as a way to shift aggregate demand.  However, when the unemployment rate is low, *tax cuts can inflate prices*.
