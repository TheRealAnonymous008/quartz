* *Japanese sentences are contextual*. Usually, the subject of the sentence is omitted entirely when it is implicitly clear what the subject is. 

* To make the subject explicit, we use は (wa; topic particle) in the following form

```
statement:  <subject> は <object>    
```

* We use subject complements using the です (desu; [[Syntax|copula]]) in the following form
```
statement: (implied subject)  <complement> です
statement: (explicit subject) <subject> は <complement> です
```

* By default, plurality is not explicitly stated in the words (i.e., using "X"-s as in English). *Plurality is implied*.

* Questions are done as follows. We affix the particle か (ka; question). 
```
<statement> か
```
* To ask "what", we either use なに (nani) or なん (nan)
	* Use なに before a particle (or before specific combinations)
	* Use なん before です or before a word indicating counts.

* Nouns can be modified using the の (no; modifier particle). 
  ```
	<noun> の <noun>  
	```
	* X の Y means that X modifies Y.  
	* In this sense, X acts as a noun adjunct.
