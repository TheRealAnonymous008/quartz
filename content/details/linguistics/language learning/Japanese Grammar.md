# Sentence Construction
* *Japanese sentences are contextual*. Usually, the subject of the sentence is omitted entirely when it is implicitly clear what the subject is. 
* By default, plurality is not explicitly stated in the words (i.e., using "X"-s as in English). *Plurality is implied*.

* We use subject complements using です (desu; [[Parts of Speech|copula]]) in the following form
```
(implied subject)  <complement> です
(explicit subject) <subject> は <complement> です
```

* To perform negation, we use the negative form じゃないです (ja nai desu) in the following form (we are saying A is not noun B.)
	```
	<A> は <B> c
	```
	* Alternatively, if we are being more formal, we say  じゃありません (ja arimasen)
	* If we are writing, it is more appropriate to use  ではありません (de wa arimasen)

* Japanese typically does not use pronouns. For example.
	* Instead of あなた (you), we use the name and title to refer to the second person.


* To ask "what", we either use なに (nani) or なん (nan)
	* Use なに before a particle (or before specific combinations)
	* Use なん before です or before a word indicating counts.
* Japanese has three way distinction when it comes to demonstrative pronouns

|                                                                                      | Proximal (This) | Medial (That) | Distal (That There) |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| Pertaining to a general thing                                                        | これ              | それ            | あれ                  |
| Pertaining to a specific thing (must be followed by a noun)                          | この              | その            | あの                  |
| Pertaining to a place (hence, they might be translated as here / there / over there) | ここ              | そこ            | あそこ                 |

* The distal demonstratives are also used to pertain to implicitly known objects (that is, something both speaker and listener know).
* For the れ series, the pronoun stands alone
* For the の series, the syntax should bee
  ```
  <の demonstrative>  + <noun>
	```

# Verbs
* *Verbs can take on various forms* called **conjugates**. There are three primary classifications of interest
	* **Pentagrade Verbs**  (五段) or  う-verbs. These verbs make use of all five vowels in their conjugates
	* **Monograde Verbs**  (一段) or る-verbs. These verbs make use of only one vowel in their conjugates. 
	* **Irregular Verbs** - verbs which do not follow either pattern.

* In conjugation, the *verb stem remains invariant among all conjugates*.
* Conjugation simply means changing the final kana of the verb (in dictionary form) 
* The table below lists conjugation rules

| Form                 | Connotation                                                                 | Monograde | Pentagrade                                                                                              |
