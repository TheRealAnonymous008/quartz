* *Japanese sentences are contextual*. Usually, the subject of the sentence is omitted entirely when it is implicitly clear what the subject is. 

* To make the subject explicit, we use は (wa; topic particle) in the following form

```
statement:  <subject> は <object>    
```

* We use subject complements using です (desu; [[Parts of Speech|copula]]) in the following form
```
statement: (implied subject)  <complement> です
statement: (explicit subject) <subject> は <complement> です
```

* By default, plurality is not explicitly stated in the words (i.e., using "X"-s as in English). *Plurality is implied*.
* To perform negation, we use the negative form じゃないです (ja nai desu) in the following form (we are saying A is not noun B.)
	```
	statement: <A> は <B> c

	```
	* Alternatively, if we are being more formal, we say either  じゃありません (ja arimasen)
	* If we are writing, it is more appropriate to use  ではありません (de wa arimasen)

* Questions are done as follows. We affix the particle か (ka; question). 
```
<statement> か
```


* Nouns can be modified using the の (no; modifier particle). 
  ```
	<noun> の <noun>  
	```
	* X の Y means that X modifies Y.  
	* In this sense, X acts as a noun adjunct.
* We can say "too" using も (mo; particle). The syntax is as follows
	```
	statement: <subject> も <object> 
	```
	In use, this means that to say $A$ is $B$; $X$ is $B$ too, we say
	```
	<A> は <B>
	<X> も <B>
	```

* We can affix the sentence with either the ね or よ particle as follows
	```
	<statement> ね (<statement>, right?)
	<statement> よ (<statement>, I tell you.)
	```
# Pronouns

* To ask "what", we either use なに (nani) or なん (nan)
	* Use なに before a particle (or before specific combinations)
	* Use なん before です or before a word indicating counts.
* Japanese has three way distinction when it comes to demonstrative pronouns

|                                                                                      | Proximal (This) | Medial (That) | Distal (That There) |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| Pertaining to a general thing                                                        | これ              | それ            | あれ                  |
| Pertaining to a specific thing (must be followed by a noun)                          | この              | その            | あの                  |
| Pertaining to a place (hence, they might be translated as here / there / over there) | ここ              | そこ            | あそこ                 |

* The distal demonstratives are also used to pertain to implicitly known objects (that is, something both speaker and listener know).
* For the れ series, the pronoun stands alone
* For the の series, the syntax should bee
  ```
  <の demonstrative>  + <noun>
	```
