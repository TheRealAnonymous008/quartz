* The phonological rules of a language can influence its [[Morphology|morphological rules]].
* **Phonotactics** - the rules that govern phoneme sequences within a language.
* Phonological rules not only cover phonotactics, but how to resolve potential contradictions within phonotactics.
	* These rules also include where to place emphasis via accents.
	* It is possible to know one of the phonotactics and the repairs for contradictions in the phonotactics, but not the other.

* Like morphological rules, phonological rules have rule orderings--the enforcement of some rules is prioritized over others in case of contradictions between rules. This is called **optimality theory**.
	* The hope of optimality theory is that there are universal constraints across languages (with languages having their own rule orderings for these constraints.)
	* By specifying broad enough constraints, we can capture general rules that can be made about the language, and allow for cross-language comparison.

* *Phonological rules talk about sound classes*

# Common Rules
* **Devoicing** - some sounds are devoiced under certain conditions, even when they normally would not be.
	* Many languages devoice final obstruents. 

* **Assimilation Rules** - one sound becomes more like another sounds.
	* **Vowel Harmonies** - vowels are articulated differently depending on the other phonemes in the word. 
	* **Sibilant Harmonies** - sibilants are articulated differently depending on other phonemes in the word.

* **Feature Spreading** - some rules (like vowel harmony) allow a feature of a sound (i.e., roundedness) to appear in multiple places.
	* Another way to say this, is that some rules may specify that for certain words, all vowels should share a feature (i.e., all vowels are back).

* Many languages put their stresses as far left or as far right as possible (subject to other rules), for words that have only one stress.

* **Sonority Sequencing Principle** - in general, for most languages, the initial sound of the syllable must rise in sonority (loudness), and the ending sound of the syllable must fall in sonority  
	* This is why vowels tend to be in the middle of syllables.
