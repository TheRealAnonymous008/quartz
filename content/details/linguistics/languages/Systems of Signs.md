* The **signary** pertains to the complete inventory of the basic signs of a given writing system. 
# Words and Logographs
* Words are the typical units of lexicology and lexicography. They are meaningful and can stand alone as a complete utterance.
	* Words have *positional mobility*. They can be taken out of context and arranged in lists. 
* However, what constitutes a word is highly debatable and not universal across other languages.
* The structural make-up of words depends on typological characteristics of languages.
	* In **isolating languages** words are invariant in that they do not undergo regular formal alterations that serve [[Syntax|grammatical]] functions 
	* In **inflecting languages** words are changed to express grammatical relationships.
	* In **agglutinating languages** words are built up out of units expressing grammatical relations.
	* In **polysynthetic languages** it is difficult to distinguish words from other linguistic entities such as clauses and sentences. 

* The orthographic word is the *unit bounded by spaces in the written languages*. The phonological word is *the corresponding unit for speech*. 
* Words are not based on prior explicit linguistic knowledge. That is, *they came as written signs interpreted as words* which were then recognized as operational units of the writing system. 

* **Logographic Writing** - writing where the basic functional units are interpreted as words. 
* **Rebus writing** - Loss of the pictorial quality of the signs facilitated their transfer to semantically unrelated words
* **Ideographic Writing** - the basic functional unit is interpreted as an idea and meaning
* **Nuclear Writing** - writing which omits grammatical information.

* **Double Articulation** - (aka duality of structure). It means there are two levels of patterning -- a language can be divided into meaningful units, but at the same time it can be divided into meaningless phonological segments. 
	* Units may serve as independent characters or as part of other units. 
	* It is a defining characteristic of human language. 

* Some languages (such as Sumerian and Chinese) started out by depicting pictures of objects. The referents of these signs were physical objects. 
* More complex ideas then required extending the language. However, these followed the rebus principle where signs gradually lost their pictorial quality. 
	* Some signs also acquired double meanings and homonyms. This meant that signs had to be differentiated either orthographically or phonetically.
	* In Sumerian, writing transitioned from the nuclear form (what Chinese has) to a from that includes grammatical information to provide clues about the grammatical form of words. 
	* An alternative path is taken by Chinese where words are not modified when they are used in a sentence. 

* Signs also began to be combined. 
	* In the case of Sumerian-like languages, simple signs were aggregated to produce more complex signs. 
	* In the case of Chinese-like languages, the radicals in each character did not correspond to a general rule. Rather, the language's vocabulary simply extended. 
# Syllables and Syllabaries
* A **syllable** is a unit of speech that can be articulated in isolation and bear a single degree of stress. Their specific structure is dictated by [[Phonetics]]. 
	* Syllables consist of a **nucleus** (usually a vowel) and an optional initial and final **margin** (usually consonants).
	* It can also be divided into an **onset** which is the initial margin, and the **rhyme** which is further divided into the **peak** (roughly the nucleus) and **coda**
	* A syllable with a vowel in coda position is **open**, and with a consonant it is **closed**. 
	* A syllable is **heavy** if it includes either a long vowel, a consonant in coda position or a complex type. 
	* *For the most part, syllables follow C-V-C form*. [^syl-1]. 

* In this context, languages can be characterized based on 
	* Their syllabic structure and syllabication rules (i.e. CVC or CVC-CV).
	* The importance of stress in defining and articulating the word.
	* The importance of vowel length in distinguishing between words.
	* Pitch levels. **Tone Languages** are languages that use the pitch level to distinguish words. When tone is important, it usually cannot be abstracted from an atonal syllable.
		* Sometimes, tone may interact with other phonological distinctions such that certain tones are restricted to certain syllables. 

[^syl-1]: Semitic languages such as Hebrew are an exception to this .They follow C-V-C-V.

* The requirements of a phonemic analysis are not the same as those of designing a practical writing system.

* *Fewer syllables means a simpler language*. However, no language can encode all the syllabic distinctions inherent within them.

* **Syllabaries** - are writing systems that operate on basic graphic units that are interpreted as speech syllables (for example Japanese kana)
	* *These languages join syllables to form longer words*. 
	* These also tend to have a reduced number of symbols. [^syl-2]. More symbols would imply more syllables to articulate them, however any redundancies (i.e., symbols pronounced the same way) could be removed.
	* *It is economic*. The number of the speech syllables of a language is closed while that of words is open. *However, there is a trade-off with clarity of the language*. 
	* *Syllabaries tend to be incomplete*. Regardless, the incompleteness arises from the fact that good knowledge of the language is required for reading them. 

[^syl-2]: Examples include Cuneiform, Korean, Japanese and Vietnamese. 

* Some languages have developed both syllabographic components without sacrificing logography. These developments happen either gradually or to adapt with modern usage. 

* *Modern writing systems were designed with the syllabic structure of the language in mind.* The syllable is an intuitive unit of speech and so must, heuristically, correspond to some unit of writing  as well. 
* *Ancient writing systems reflect the discovery of the linguistic unit of the symbol*. 
	* When a writing system with a strong [[Morphology|morphographic]] component is adopted for another language it is possible to assign new interpretations of words or morphemes of the recipient language to extant signs of the donor language

* *The suitability of using syllables as a basis for the writing system depends on the syllable structure*. Syllabaries face two problems 
	* Inadequate linguistic fit -  Comes from being [[Trade Offs|too detailed]] with translating syllables to symbols (i.e., including tone). Can also come with very complex syllabic structures.  
	* Extensive signaries - having many symbols. Since symbols (in this case) would correspond to a syllable, this requires extensive knowledge of the syllabary and the nuances of pronunciation. 
# Segments and Alphabets
* Phonemic segments are widely believed to be what alphabetic letters encode. 
* On an abstract level, speech is representable in terms of finite sequences of segments. However, *a good description of speech need not correspond with speech itself. *

* These writing systems *use letters and alphabets*. 
* The pronounceability of alphabetic words rests on a process known as **phonological recoding** - the transformation of mental representations of sequences of letters into mental representations of sequences of [[Acoustics|sounds]]. 
* **Phonemic writing** means that there is a one-to-one correspondence between phonemes and their written representation. *This is an ideal that has not been achieved by any particular language*. There are three challenges 
	* Even in a phonemic writing system, interpretations only serve as contrasts reflected in spelling. 
	* Uncertainty arises when dealing with two distinct languages with different contrasts reflected in their letters. 
	* There is a bias in the formation of the language in that it was informed and it would simply be [[Thinking Fast And Slow|hindsight]] to say it was a phonemic recording. In other words, the language's formation likely did not have this in mind. 

* *Even within a language, letters are polyvalent -- they have more than one phonetic interpretation*. This can arise for three reasons [^seg_1] and can acuse orthographies to operate on more than one level. 
	* *Historical*: 
		* As time goes on, spoken forms change but written forms do not. This means that over time, there is a shift from using speech to using writing as the basis for the "ground-truth" of the language. 
		* Language reforms may occur 
	* *Systematic*. 
		* Similar groups of phones may be divided into phonemes differently in different languages. 
		* Letters are not only influenced by phonetics but also by morphology and the use of words. 
	* *Haphazard*
		* This can arise when adapting from another language. 
		* Includes the use of diacritics, digraphs and trigraphs which can affect the formulation of phonemes, morphemes, and graphemes.
		* Can manifest in loanwords, inconsistent spellings and technical innovations [^seg_2]

* *A higher phoneme-grapheme ratio indicates that the spelling system is more removed from phonemic writing*. Those with high ratios are called **deep** while those that are close to $1:1$ are **shallow / surface**. 
	* Surface orthographies are closer to the ideal of phonemic writing.

* An orthography can be supplemented with additional letters and diacritic marks to handle phonemic segments that have no correspondence to the letters (or require additional information about articulation)

[^seg_2]: Such as printing and the Ã¾ symbol. This is the reason why we have "Ye Olde Tavern", where the Y  corresponds to "Th". 

* **Suprasegmentals** - they do not occur before or after, but occur together with other vowels and consonants. They relate to syllables and sometimes larger units. 
* *Suprasegmentals make it more difficult to segment the language*.
