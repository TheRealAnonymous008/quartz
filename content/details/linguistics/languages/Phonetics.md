* Speech involves the production of an airflow which gets obstructed in various ways in the vocal tract.
# Articulation of Consonants
* One way of categorizing obstructions is to consider the **place of articulation** -- where is the flow getting obstructed
	* **[Bilabial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilabial_consonant)** - involves obstruction with both lips.
	* **[Labiodental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labiodental_consonant)** - articulated with lower lip and upper teeth
	* **Coronals** - articulated with the front part of the tongue (the tip or blade).
		* **[Interdental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdental_consonant)** - made by placing the tongue between the teeth.
		* **[Dental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_consonant)** - articulated with the tongue against the upper teeth
		* **[Alveolar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alveolar_consonant)** - made by placing the tip of the tongue against the alveolar ridge (behind the top teeth) 
		* **[Postalveolar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postalveolar_consonant)** - articulated with the tongue blade slightly behind the alveolar ridge.
		* **[Palatoalveolar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palato-alveolar_consonant)** - like postalveolar, except with articulated with a bunched up tongue.
		* **[Retroflex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroflex_consonant)** - the tongue has a curled shaped and articulated between the alveolar ridge and the hard palate.

	* **Guttural** - articulated in the back part of the oral cavity.
		* **[Palatal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatal_consonant)** - articulated with the back of the tongue against the hard palate -- behind the alveolar ridge where the mouth reaches its height.  
		* **[Velar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velar_consonant)** - articulated with the back of the tongue against the soft palate, the back of the roof of the mouth.
		* **[Uvular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uvular_consonant)** - articulated with the back of the tongue against the uvula. 
		* **[Pharyngeal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharyngeal_consonant)** - articulated primarily in the pharynx
		* **[Glottal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glottal_consonant)** - articulated using the glottis (i.e., the vocal folds).

* Sounds can be **voiced** - where the vocal cords vibrate or **voiceless** - where the vocal cords do not vibrate.
	* **Aspirated** - pertains to the strong burst of breath when articulating a sound. Aspirated sounds tend to be voiceless.

* Sounds can be categorized by the **manner of articulation** 
	* **Obstruent** - sound is created by blocking airflow in the oral cavity.
		* **Plosives** - there is a blocking of the vocal tract and no nasal air flow so that the air stop completely.
		* **Fricative** - there is noisy airflow at the place of articulation. Airflow is hindered by creating a small aperture.
			* **Sibilants** - the airflow is guided by a groove in the tongue towards the teeth.
			* **Lateral Fricatives** - the noisy airflow occurs on one or both sides of the edge of the tongue.
	* **Sonorant** - there is no pressure building in the oral cavity, allowing air to pass through. 
		* **Nasal** - there is an occlusion of the vocal tract but air passes through the nose.
		* **Approximants** - there is very little obstruction. 
			* **Glide** - an approximant pronounced like a vowel but with the tongue closer to the roof of the mouth.
			* **Lateral** - approximants pronounced with the side of the tongue.

	* **Rhotics** - the sound is articulated in an R-like manner where there are one or more brief occlusions in the sound. Together with Laterals, they form the **liquids**.

	* **Affricate** - begins like a plosive, but releases into a fricative.
	* **Flap** - a momentary closure of the oral cavity.
	* **Trill** - the articulator is held in place and the air causes it to vibrate.

	* **Ejectives** - airstream is powered by an upward movement of the glottis.
	* **Implosives** - airstream is powered by a downward movement of the glottis.
	* **Clicks** - the back of the tongue is used to create a vacuum in the mouth, causing air to rush in. 
# Vowels
* Vowels can depend on the "height" of the mouth.
	* **Close**  - the tongue is positioned close to the mouth but not to the point of constriction
	* **Near-Close** - the tongue is positioned close to the mouth but not as constricted as for a closed vowel.
	* **Close-Mid** - $1/3$ of the gap between closed to open
	* **Mid** - $1/2$ of the gap between closed to open
	* **Open-Mid** - $2/3$ of the gap between closed to open
	* **Near-Open** - the tongue is positioned similar to an open vowel but more constricted.
	* **Open** - the tongue is positioned as far as possible from the roof of the tongue.

* Vowels are also specified by how far back from the mouth the tongue is placed.
	* **Front** - the tongue is positioned far forward in the mouth without constriction. They tend to sound brighter
	* **Central** - the tongue is positioned halfway between front and back .
	* **Back** - the tongue is positioned relatively back in the mouth without creating constriction. They tend to sound darker.
		* **Raised** - the tongue is raised upwards.
		* **Retracted** - the tongue is pulled backwards and downward into the pharynx.

* A vowel can be **rounded** if the lips form a circular opening or **unrounded** if the lips are relaxed when pronouncing the vowel.

* A vowel can be **tense** -- wherein it is pronounced less to the center, longer duration, and with a narrower mouth.
* A vowel can be **lax** -- wherein it is pronounced more to the center, shorter duration, and with a wider mouth.
# Phonemes
* **Voice Onset Time** - the duration between the release of a plosive and the beginning of a vocal fold vibration. 
	* We have an arbitrary dividing line in the continuum of VOT.
* **Allophones** - linguistically non-significant variants of each phoneme.
	* Allophones cannot both appear in the same word of the language.

* The distribution of phonemes for a language can be defined to create phonetic rules on the sounds that are possible within the language.
* In fact, generalizations made by phonetic rules can cover for variations due to [[Morphology|allomorphs]].

* **Moraic Structures** - phonological time is broken into equal lengths, **mora** rather than into long and short syllables .
