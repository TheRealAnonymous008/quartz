* Diacritics map from unvoiced consonants to voiced consonants namely
	* k - g
	* s - z
	* t - d
	* h - b (diagonal strokes)
	* h - p (circle)
* It is more common to use じ and ず  for ji and zi 
* We use つ ("tsu") to transcribe double consonants.
* We use ん ("n") + hiragana with an n-sound  for double consonant n's When it is followed by a vowel or at the end of an utterance, ん indicates that the preceding vowel is [[Phonetics|long and nasalized]]. 
* For blended vowels
