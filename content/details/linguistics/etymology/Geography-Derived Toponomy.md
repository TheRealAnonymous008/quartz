* Some places derive their names from [[Geography|geographical features]] that are present within the area.
* Sometimes we see that administrative regions' names derive from the names of nearby geographical features.  Other times, the inverse is true -- the geographical feature defines the name of the administrative region.
* Note that some terms are loose (i.e.e, Bay and Bight). Sometimes the wrong term may be used in naming (for example, calling a Cove a Pond).

[^lake]: Some Seas may be called a lake (i.e., the Caspian Sea is a lake). Lakes can also be mistaken for seas and vice versa.
[^beach]: We also use any inlet or island related names when naming a beach since these tend to occur together
[^cliff]: Often cliffs are named with an association to their mountains. Gorges and Canyons may also be used
