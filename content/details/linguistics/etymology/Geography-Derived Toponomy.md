* Some places derive their names from [[Geography|geographical features]] that are present within the area.
* Sometimes we see that administrative regions' names derive from the names of nearby geographical features.  Other times, the inverse is true -- the geographical feature defines the name of the administrative region.
* Note that some terms are loose (i.e.e, Bay and Bight). Sometimes the wrong term may be used in naming (for example, calling a Cove a Pond). 
# Water Courses
* **Bayou** - a body of water found in a flat low lying area. Often refers to a briny slow moving stream 
* **Beck** - a stream flowing through a narrow valley.
* **Bourne / Burn /  Winterbourne** - an ephemeral stream or river. Typically pertaining to areas with chalk or limestone.
* **Brook** - a stream smaller than a creak fed by a string or seep. Small and shallow, allowing for it to be forded. 
* **Creek** - a stream smaller than a river. 
* **Crossing** - a portion of the stream where structures may restrict the flow of the stream. 
* **Distributary / Arm / Channel** - a stream that branches off and flows away from a main stream channel. 
* **Meanders** - looping serpentine changes of direction of a stream. 
* **Rapids** - the turbulent, fast flowing stretch of a stream or river.
* **River / Yeo** - a naturally flowing watercourse flowing on the surface or inside caves towards another waterbody at a lower elevation (or into the ground / becomes dry).
* **Rivulet / Rill** - a very small stream
* **Spring** - the point at which a stream emerges from an underground course through sediments. 
* **Stream / Run** - a continuous body of surface water flowing within the bed and banks of a channel.
	* **Run** - the smooth flowing part of a stream.

* **Tributary / Branch / Fork** - a stream that contributes to a larger stream or which joins another river. 
* **Waterfall / Cascade / Falls / Force / Snout** - any point in a stream where water flows over a vertical drop.

* **Estuary** - a partially enclosed coastal body of brackish water with one or more watercourses flowing into it, and with free connection to the sea.
* **Harbor / Port** - a landform where a section of a body of water is protected and deep enough to allow ships to be anchored. It can be a Strait or Inlet.
* **Inlet** - an indentation of a shore line that leads to a larger body of water.  
	* **Bay** - a recessed coastal body of water that directly connects to a larger main body of water (i.e., an ocean or lake). Interchangeable with Bight
	* **Bight** - a concave bend in a coastline, typically broad, open, shallow and only slightly recessed. It is much shallower than a Sound. Interchangeable with Bay, although often less curved than a bay.
	* **Cove** - a small coastal inlet with a narrow entrance, often circular shape, and situated within a larger bay. 
	* **Fjord / Firth** - a long, narrow, sea inlet with steep sides or cliffs created by glaciers.
	* **Gulf** - a large inlet from an ocean into a landmass, typically with a narrower opening than a bay
	* **Ria** - a coastal inlet formed by submergence of a drowned river valley, typically featuring dendritic patterns.
	* **Sound** - a smaller body of water usually connected to a sea or ocean, deeper than a bight and wider than a fjord.
* **Island / Isle** - a piece of subcontinental land surrounded by water.
	* **Ait / Eyot** - an island in a river or lake. 
	* **Archipelago** - a chain of islands. 
	* **Atoll** - a ring-shaped island, including a coral rim, that encircles a lagoon. Possibly with coral islands or cays.
	* **Barrier Island / Barrier** - an island with an area of sand where the coast is parallel to the tidal action. 
	* **Cay / Caye / Key** - a small low elevation, sandy island on the surface of a coral reef.
	* **Reef** - an outcrop of rock in the sea formed by the growth of coral skeletons.
* **Isthmus / Bridge / Pass** - a narrow piece of land connecting two larger areas across an expanse of water by which they are otherwise separated.
	* **Tombolo** - a sandy or shingle isthmus
* **Lagoon** - a shallow body of water separated from a larger one by a narrow landform
	* **Barachois** - a lagoon partially or totally separated from the ocean by a sand or shingle bar.
* **Peninsula** - a landform surrounded by more than half but not entirely by water.
* **River Mouth** - the portion where a river flows into a larger body of water. 
* **Skerry** - a small rocky island or islet too small for human habitation.
* **Strait / Firth / Pass / Passage** - a landform connecting two seas or two water basins
	* **Canal** - a man-made channel
	* **Channel** - wider than a strait.
	* **Passage** - typically connects waters between islands.
# Elevation-Based Landmasses

	* **Cove** - a small valley between two ridge linens closed at one or both ends.
	* **Dale** - a wide open valley
	* **Dell** - a grassy valley or dried stream bed. Often a wooded area.
	* **Glen / Glyn** - a valley that is long, narrow, and deep and bounded by gently sloped concave sides.
	* **Gulch** - a deep V-shaped valley formed by erosion. Larger than a gully. May contain a creek bed.
	* **Hollow / Coulee** - a general term for a drainage zone. Typically pertaining to a small valley surrounded by mountains or ridges. Alternatively, a dry stream bed.
	* **Rift** - pertaining to rift valleys. A linear shaped lowland between several highlands. They span a large area and are a result of tectonic activity.
	* **Strath** - a large valley that is wide and shallow.

# Biome-Based Landmasses

[^lake]: Some Seas may be called a lake (i.e., the Caspian Sea is a lake). Lakes can also be mistaken for seas and vice versa.
[^beach]: We also use any inlet or island related names when naming a beach since these tend to occur together
[^cliff]: Often cliffs are named with an association to their mountains. Gorges and Canyons may also be used
