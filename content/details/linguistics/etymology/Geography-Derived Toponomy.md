* Some places derive their names from [[Geography|geographical features]] that are present within the area.
* Sometimes we see that administrative regions' names derive from the names of nearby geographical features.  Other times, the inverse is true -- the geographical feature defines the name of the administrative region.
# Water Courses
* If a *color* is associated with the watercourse's etymology, it usually pertains to the color of the water.
* Watercourses sometimes have ties to *deities* -- river gods and goddesses. Typically river deities are female and are referred to as Mother. This ties into rivers whose names translate to "Mother Goddess".
	* This extends to origins that are *mythical* in nature or are based on stories and legends associated with the watercourse
* Other etymologies for streams include variations of long, wide, big, or meandering. It may also pertain to height (i.e. for waterfalls). In general, we notice characterizations based on the *shape of the stream's flow.*
	* This extends to talking about the *nature of the stream's flow* (i.e., turbulent, quiet, etc.)
* The name of a watercourse may derive from other watercourses. For example, tributaries, branches, and cascades. 
* Watercourses, especially rivers, can be the core of certain ecosystems. Thus, there are cases when they are named *after peoples or animals that prominently live nearby*.
