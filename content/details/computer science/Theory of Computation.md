* Computation can be seen as the [[Graph Theory|networking]] of atomic operations to transduce input data into output data.
* Computational circuits handle binary differences and are the basis for [[Information Theory|information]] processing.


* Undecidability can be seen as analogous to the [[Quantum Mechanics|Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle]] and [[Mathematics|Godel's Incompleteness Theorem]], defining the limits of what is possible.
