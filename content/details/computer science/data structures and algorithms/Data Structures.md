* To some extent, all data structures are just graphs in some manner with additional constraints and invariants.

# Graph-Based
* [[Graph Theory|Graphs]]
	* [[Trails, Walks, Paths and Cycles]]
* Tree-based:
	* [[Binary Search Tree]]
	* [[Heap Data Structure]]
	* [[B Tree]]
	* [[Trie]]

# Augmented
* In general, data structures can be augmented beyond their original use case if their structure and operations can help solve another problem with more data.
  
  Augmenting follows these general steps
	* Choose a data structure
	* Determine additional information to maintain in the underlying data structure
	* Verify that we can maintain the additional information for the basic modifying operations on the underlying data structure. 
	* Develop new operations.

* While the steps are outlined above, it is important to note that designing may not follow these steps.
