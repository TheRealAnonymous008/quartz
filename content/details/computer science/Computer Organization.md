* The design principles of an Instruction Set Architecture are good design principles in general.

* An **Application Binary Interface** is an interface between two binary program modules that defines how data structures are accessed in machine code. It specifies:
	1. A standardized [[Instruction Set Architecture]] 
	2. Register file structure and stack organization
	3. Size, layouts and alignments of basic data types
	4. [[Procedure Calling Workflow#Calling Conventions|Calling conventions]]
	5. How an application should make system calls to the [[Operating System]] 
	6. If the ABI specifies direct system calls  rather than procedure calls to system call stubs
	7. The system call numbers.
* A **Stored-Program Computer** is a computer that stores programs and data in accessible memory.
	* These programs operate on other programs.

* **Assembly** provides a *middle-ground between high-level programming languages and machine code* by featuring textual representations of instructions closer to the ones understandable to the machine, but still readable to humans.
	* They are dependent on the ISA.
	* Generally faster, requires less memory, and more flexible than high level programming languages.
