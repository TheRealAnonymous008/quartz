* [C5W3LO4 Beam Search](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLWuzLLSIgw) - beam search is an algorithm similar to BFS and DFS (but is not guaranteed to find maxima), wherein given beam length $B$, we select the top $B$ likely outputs at each step of the search. The goal is to find the likely $B$-length sentence using this search.
* [C5W3LO4 Refining Beam Search](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb__z7LlN_4) - use length normalization techniques to optimize beam search (maximize log likelihood, average based on sentence length).
