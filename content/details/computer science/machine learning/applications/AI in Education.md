# Papers
* *A Multi-Agent System for Computer Science Education by Shi, Shang and Chen (July, 2000)* - A proposal for use of a multi-agent pedagogical systems to teach students computer science. The agent consists of personalized agents to teach a subject, assess students, and improve the curriculum.

* *Self-Regulated Learning in Learning Environments with Pedagogical Agents that Interact in Natural Language by Graesser (2010) *- A survey of Self Regulated Learning in pedagogical agents.

* *Lurch -- A Word Processor that Can Grade Students' Proofs by Carter and Monks (2013)* - introduces Lurch, a word processor that can assess whether statements in a document are mathematically sound. The paper focuses on the UX and the evaluation of the UX rather than the system itself. It is more geared towards education than being a powerful proof engine.

* *Beetle II -- Deep Natural Language Understanding and Automatic Feedback Generation for Intelligent Tutoring in Basic Electricity and Electronics by Dzikovska et. al. (Jun 10, 2014)* - introduces Beetle II - a rule-based system that facilitates learning for a complex topic (electronics) by allowing students to experiment and by giving elaborative feedback via a symbolic NLP system coupled with domain knowledge.

* *Robot Tutoring-- On the Feasibility of Using Cognitive Systems as Tutors in Introductory Programming Education by Muller et. al (June 14, 2018)* - Cognitive systems like IBM Watson can only replace tutors (used to answer common questions) in a limited fashion, especially when they are deterministic, and unable to infer intent.

* *Automated Scoring-- Beyond Natural Language Processing by Madnani and Cahil (August, 2018)*- a position paper that argues the problem of Automated Scoring requires a multi-disciplinary view that focuses not only on the application and advancement of NLP techniques, but also a consideration on how stakeholders will deploy, use, and be affected by Automated Scoring technology.

* *Zero Shot Learning for Code Education - Rubric Sampling with Deep Learning Inference by Wu, Mosse, Goodman and Piech (Dec 17, 2018)* - introduces Rubric Sampling. It generatively infers how likely a student response is given some misconceptions about the topic.

* *Inferring Concept Prerequisite Relations from Online Educational Resources by Roy, Madhyastha, Lawrence, and Rajan (Jan 23, 2019)* - PREREQ Paper. It aims to infer pre-requisite relations between particular concepts based on data gathered from MOOCs.

* *Generating Response-Specific Elaborated Feedback Using Long-Form Neural Question Answering by Olney (June 2021)*  - studies how to retrieve documents to provide elaborative feedback to students, and how to post-process this feedback.

* *Towards Trustworthy AutoGrading of Short, Multilingual, Multi-type Answers by Schneider, Richner, and Riser (Mar, 11, 2022)* - fine tunes a transformer model using a more diverse short-form QA dataset for the purposes of AutoGrading. Notably ,it achieves more trust via more accuracy by allowing humans to manually grade difficult questions determined by a certain threshold of desired accuracy . It achieves better performance than other models, at the cost of higher variability .

* *The Landscape of Teaching Resources for AI Education by Druga, Otero, and Ko (July, 2022)* - an analysis into the current state of resources for learning about AI. It finds that most existing resources are teacher-unfriendly (i.e., hard to use for teachers.)

* *C3-IOC -- A Career Guidance System for Assessing Student Skills using Machine Learning and Network Visualization by Jose-Garcia et. al (Dec 1, 2022)* - introduces C3-IoC, a career guidance system for IT which enables users to identify their hard and soft skills as well as where they land in the job landscape.

* *Survey for Smart and Adaptive Education by Bezerra, Duraes, and Novais (December 15, 2022)* - Conducts a survey on how Artificial Intelligence has been used to make a smarter and more adaptive education system. AI allows education systems to be more adaptive and interactive.

* *Fuzzy Soft Skills Assessment through Active Learning Sessions by de Novais, Matelli and Silva (May 11, 2023)* - introduces FSSA, a Fuzzy based method to assess student skills after active learning sessions. Assessments were validated based on a domain expert (a behavioral expert) and based on data collected from students.
