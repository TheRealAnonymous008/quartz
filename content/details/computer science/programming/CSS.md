* The flow of CSS is essentially select elements on the web page and then apply styling. 
* In CSS, *everything has a box around it*. Boxes have a padding, border, and margin box that surround the content box. 
* *Prefer to use the logical properties over the physical properties*. These are made relative to the screen so they are much more future-proof.
* **FlexBox** is for arranging items in a one-dimensional layout. The items will expand to fill additional space or shrink to fit in smaller spaces.  **Grid** is the same as FlexBox but for 2-Dimensional layouts. 
	* anything with `justify` pertains to the axis parallel to writing direction.
	* anything with `align` pertains to the axis perpendicular to writing direction.
	* anything with `content` pertains to the container of the items (i.e., the element with the attribute).
	* anything with `items`  pertains to the items inside the container.
	* anything with `self` functions the same as `content` except it is placed in the item.
* Some common length values
	* `em` - font size of the parent (for text) or the element itself.
	* `rem` - font size of the root element.
	* `vb` - viewport-block
