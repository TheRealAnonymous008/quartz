* **The Senior Developer Approach**: Take existing code from reputable sources rather than using your own code. Saves time and effort and reduces the probability of bugs.
	* Remember *the best code is no code*. 

* **Ubiquitous Language** - the practice of building up a common, rigorous language between developers and users. This allows
	* Developers and Users to better understand the problem specifications and each other.
	* Knowledge of the domain to be encoded directly into the code, so that future developers can easily catch up.
	* More readable code that aligns with the problem specifications.

* A lot of Software Engineering approaches borrow from [[Manufacturing]] which makes sense considering the similarities between the two processes.
