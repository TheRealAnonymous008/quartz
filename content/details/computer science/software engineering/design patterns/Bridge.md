* *Aka*: Handle / Body
* *Intent*: Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently

# Applicability
* You want to avoid a permanent binding between an abstraction and its implementation. This might be the case when implementation must be selected or switched at runtime.
* Both abstractions and implementations should be extensible by subclassing.
* Changes in the implementation of an abstraction should have no impact on clients.
* You have a proliferation of classes
* You want to share an implementation using multiple objects and this fact should be hidden from the client

# Consequences
* Implementation is not bound permanently to an interface. 
* Encourages a better structured system via layering.
* Improved extensibility for abstraction and implementation.
* Hiding implementation details from clients.
* Complicates dependency injection
* Builder classes are forced to be mutable

# Implementation
* If there is only one implementor, then creating an abstract implementor class isnâ€™t necessary.
* Creating the right Implementor object:
	* If Abstraction knows all Concrete Implementors, then it can instantiate one of each in its constructor and decide.
	* Choose a default implementation to change later.
	* Delegate the decision to another object.
* Abstractions can share implementors.
* Use multiple inheritance
