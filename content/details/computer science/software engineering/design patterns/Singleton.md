* *Intent*: Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it

# Applicability
* There must be exactly one instance of a class accessible to clients from a well-known access point.
* When the sole instance should be extensible by subclassing and clients should be able to use an extended instance without modifying their code.

# Consequences
* Controlled access to sole instance.
* Reduced name space
* Permits refinement of operations and representation.
* Permits a variable number of instances.
* More flexible than class operations (i.e.  static member functions)

# Implementation
* Ensure a unique instance by hiding its constructor.

## Subclassing
* Determine which singleton to use in a singletonâ€™s instance operation.
* Take the implementation of Instance out of the parent class
* Use a registry of singletons.
