* Most of Computer Graphics can be understood as the manipulation of $4\times 4$ matrices.
* Textures are not necessarily images, nor are they always necessary to solve graphics problems  (see [[Texturing in Computer Graphics]]).

* Approaches to Volume Rendering
	* **Rendering with Slices** - render each slice in the volume and adjust the alphas based on where the camera is looking at.
