# What is Antimicrobial Resistance?
* **Antimicrobial Resistance** refers to a phenomenon where microbes have developed resistances to certain antibiotics due to genetic adaptations. This can be done:
	* by resisting changes caused by drugs that can alter bacterial genetic information.
	* by developing enzymes that can break down the drugs into safer compounds.
	* by conjugation--passing drug resistances across organism species or by random mutations (which is more apparent for viruses.)
* *This arose due to the use of antibiotics in almost anything disease-related, thus causing microbes to develop appropriate adaptations*.
# Other Notes
* Liposomes (and in particular **stealth liposomes**) are important in the research of drugs as they allow injection molecules into the plasma membrane.
* Many drugs act by inhibiting the transport of transmitters out of the synaptic cleft.
