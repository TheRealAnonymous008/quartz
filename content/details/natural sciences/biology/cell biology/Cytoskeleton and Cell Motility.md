* The **cytoskeleton** consists of three well-defined filamentous structures **microtubules, actin filaments, and intermediate filaments**. 
# Functions
* A **dynamic scaffold** to provide structural support and shape.
* An **internal framework** for positioning organelles within the cell interior.
* **Tracks** that direct the movement of materials
* **Motors** derived from force generating apparatuses within the cell.
	* These motors move along tracks in the cytoskeleton, and while doing so they undergo conformational changes that fuel their motion.
* Mechanisms that facilitate **cell division**, in particular, separating the chromosomes and splitting the cell.
# Composition
## [[Microtubules]]
## Intermediate Filaments
* Tough, ropelike fibers made of a variety of similar fibrous proteins. They provide mechanical strength to cells subjected to physical stress.
	* These proteins start as monomers, then dimers which are assembled into polymers in a side-by-side staggered manner anti-parallel to each other. 
	* The growth of the filament is done in the interior of the filament rather than its ends.
	* The assembly and disassembly of IFs are controlled by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of its subunits.
* These are not polarized so they would not be able to guide the motor via polarity.
	* Additionally, they tend to be less sensitive to chemical agents than other types of cytoskeletal elements.
	* They also tend to be insoluble.
* They often radiate through the cytoplasm and are interconnected via thin **cross bridges** usually made of **plectin**. Plectin consists of binding sites for an intermediate filament  on one end and a cytoskeletal structure on the other.
* Connecting the IFs to the whole cytoskeleton also allows it to serve as a scaffold for organizing the cell's structure and absorbing mechanical stresses. Thus *IFs are important in tissue-specific functions rather than basic cellular functions*. 
## [[Actin Filaments]]
# Cellular Motility
* Movement of motile cells display a similar sequence of activities:
	* Movement is initiation by the protrusion of a part of the cell surface in the direct in which the cell is to move.
	* A portion of the lower surface of the protrusion attaches to the substratum, forming temporary sites of anchorage
	* The bulk of the cell is pulled forward over the adhesive contacts, which eventually become part of the rear of the cell
	* The cell breaks its rear contacts with the substratum, causing retraction of the trailing edge, or “tail.”
* The **lamellipodium** is a broad, flattened, veil like protrusion that is the leading edge of the motile cell. It provides temporary anchorage to the substratum.
* Movement involves *assembly and disassembly of actin via actin-binding proteins*. 
	* As a cell migrates, it generates pulling forces against its substrate.
	* This causes a protrusion to form. Myosin then pulls the remaining parts of the cell.
