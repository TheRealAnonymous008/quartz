# Overview of Photosynthesis
* Photosynthesis was thought to have first developed from  **photoautotrophic** prokaryotic cells that were [[The Properties of Life from a Biological Perspective|assimilated]] by other prokaryotic cells. 
	* Although originally consuming Hydrogen Sulfide, the ones assimilated were able to make use of water.
	* The **chloroplast** is the byproduct of this assimilation. 
# Chloroplasts
* Within plants, chloroplasts are predominantly located in the **mesophyll cells**.
	* They are lens shaped and giant relative to other organelles.
	* They arise by fission from existing chloroplasts or **proplastids**. 
* The chloroplast consists of membranous sacs called **thylakoids** arranged into **grana**
	* Thylakoids have a space inside of them called the **lumen**.
	* The thylakoid membrane contains the **chlorophyll** and protein complexes that power the processes of the chloroplast
		* The membrane is high protein, low phospholipid, and high galactose-containing glycolypids which makes the layer highly fluid  (see more [[Plasma Membrane#Membrane Fluidity and Dynamics|here]]).
* The **stroma** pertains to the space outside of the thylakoids. It contains enzymes for carbohydrate synthesis. 
	* The stroma contains small double stranded circular DNA molecules and ribosomes.
# Photosynthesis
* Photosynthesis mainly consists of **light dependent** and **light independent reactions**.
### Light Dependent Reactions
* Energy from sunlight as photons is absorbed and stored as chemical energy in $\text{ATP}$ and $\text{NADPH}$. 
* When a photon strikes a chlorophyll molecule, an electron in the molecule becomes excited, which then fuels the rest of the reaction (similar to the [[Cellular Respiration#Electron Transport Chain|Electron Transport Chain]])
	* This process absorbs most of the energy from the light.
	* Chlorophyll itself absorbs red and blue light, hence why it is colored green.
	* Another pigment called **Carotenoids** absorb blue and green regions. They act as secondary light collectors, and draw excess energy away from excited chlorophyll molecules.
* Each chlorophyll is organized into **photosynthetic units** with only one **reaction-center chlorophyll** being responsible for the transfer of electrons. The remaining chlorophyll act as absorption units.
		* **Photosystem II** boosts electrons from an energy level below that of water to a midway point
			* **Photoinhibition** is a phenomenon which involves the formation of a very strong oxidizing agent in PS-II due to high intensity light.
		* **Photosystem I** raises the energy level to that above $NADP^+$.
			* PS-I was capable of **cyclic photophosphorylation** which produces ATP on its own by recycling used electrons.
				* It is thought that this gives additional ATP for carbohydrate synthesis.

### Light Independent Reactions
* Carbohydrates are synthesized from $CO_2$ using the $\text{ATP}$ and $\text{NADPH}$ synthesized from the light dependent reactions.
* These reactions are much more rapid and do not require light.
#### C3 Plants
* Makes use of **RUBISCO**  to fix $CO_2$ with $\text{RUBP}$, 
	* It is one of the most important molecules that can fix inorganic carbon.
	* It is one of the most abundant, and yet one of the most inefficient enzymes.
		* It causes **photorespiration** which releases previously fixed $\text{CO}_2$ molecules. *This is more apparent in hot, dry conditions due to the plants closing their stomata to avoid water loss but also gas exchange*.
		* Photorespiration appears to be unavoidable since $\text{RUBISCO}$ favors $\text{O}_2$ over $\text{CO}_2$. 
		* It becomes more apparent when the concentration of $\text{O}_2$ in the cell becomes too high.
* The fixing of carbon to organic carbohydrates follows the **Carbon Cycle** that comprises of:
	* The carboxylation of $\text{RUBP}$ to form $\text{PGA}$, a three carbon molecule.
	* The reduction of $\text{PGA}$ to the level of a sugar by forming $\text{GAP}$ using $\text{NADPH}$ and $\text{ATP}$.
	* Regeneration of $\text{RUBP}$ using $\text{ATP}$. 
* The Calvin cycle is [[System Dynamics|regulated]]. The enzymes in the pathway are more active in alkaline $\text{pH}$.
#### C4 Plants
* Makes use of **PEP Carboxylase** to fix $\text{CO}_2$ with **PEP** to form **oxaloacetic acid**, a four Carbon molecule.
	* PEP carboxylase continues to operate at much lower $\text{CO}_2$ levels and is not inhibited by $\text{O}_2$. 
	* It can, therefore, bypass photorespiration more effectively.
	* However, this comes at the cost of requiring more $\text{ATP}$ and $\text{NADPH}$ than the C3 pathway.
* It releases extra $\text{CO}_2$ which is then consumed in a regular C3-pathway.
#### CAM Plants
* Adapted for very hot and dry habitats.
* They make use of PEP Carboxylase for carbon fixation. However, they carry out the light dependent reactions and carbon fixation *at different times of the day*.
