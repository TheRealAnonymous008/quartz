* **Cell Walls** are found in plant, fungi, and bacteria cells.
# Functions
* It maintains turgor [[Fluid Mechanics|pressure]] within the cell which gives plant cells their characteristic polyhedral shape.
* They serve as skeletons for both the cell and the organism.
* Protects against damage from abrasion and pathogens
* Mediates cell-cell interactions.
# Composition
* They contain a fibrous element embedded in a non-fibrous gel-like matrix.
* **Cellulose** makes up the fibrous elements of the cell wall. They are organized into **microfibrils** that make the cell wall rigid and add tensile strength.
	* Microfibrils are often organized in cross-hatching fashion, where the microfibrils of one layer are oriented perpendicular to those of adjacent layers.
	* Cellulose is synthesized via **cellulose synthase** on the cell surface.
* The **cell matrix** consists of the non-fibrous parts which are synthesized within the cytoplasm
	* **Hemicellulose** - branched polysaccharides that bind and cross-link microfibrils to form a resilient network
	* **Pectins** - negatively charged glacturonic acid-containing polysaccharides. They form a hydrated gel that fills the space of the fibrous elements.
	* There are proteins that facilitate dynamic activities
		* **Expansins** - facilitates relaxation of the cell wall at certain sites.
		* **Kinases** - transmit signals from cell-wall to cytoplasm.
# Growth
* They arise from a thin **cell plate** which then matures by incorporate additional materials.
* **Primary Cell Walls** are the flexible walls of growing cells. **Secondary Cell Walls** are the thicker walls found in mature plant cells.
	* The transition from primary to secondary occurs due to an increase in cellulose.
	* They often incorporate **lignin** for additional structural support.
