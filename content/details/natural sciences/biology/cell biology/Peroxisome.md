* **Peroxisomes** are small membranous vesicles that contain enzymes for a variety of purposes.
	* Primarily, they are sites for *synthesizing and breaking down hydrogen peroxide* through **catalase**.
	* They also help in the breakdown of certain lipid chains.
* They form by splitting off from other organelles.
* They also engage in aerobic metabolism.
* During [[Chloroplasts and Photosynthesis#Photosynthesis|photosynthesis]], the peroxisome is involved in the shuttling of materials from the chloroplast (i.e., glycolate), to the mitochondrion (glyoxylate) and then from the mitochondrion (glycine and serine) back to the chloroplast (glycerate) for use in forming $3-\text{PGA}$.
