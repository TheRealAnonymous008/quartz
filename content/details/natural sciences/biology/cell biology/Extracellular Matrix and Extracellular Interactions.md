* Extracellular interactions allow for cells to communicate with each other and respond to external stimuli.
# Extracellular Matrix
* The **extracellular matrix** (ECM) consists of an organized network of secreted molecules that provides scaffolding and plays a regulatory role for cellular activity and shape.
	* The ECM tends to be made of extended fibrous protein which self-assemble into a three-dimensional network.
	* The ECM *is a dynamic structure* which undergoes mechanical motion, as well as continued degradation and reconstruction.
		* The degradation is accomplished through **matrix metalloproteinases** (MMPs). which digest nearly all the ECM components, though to be for *tissue remodeling and restructuring*. 
	* **Mechanotransduction** - the process of converting mechanical stimuli chemical signals in the cytoplasm.
		* It is thought to be mediated by the stretching of some adaptor proteins, which exposes additional blinding sites .
### Components
* **Collagens** - fibrous glycoproteins with notably *high tensile strength*. They contain triple helixes of $\alpha$ chains (Type I, II, III) and possibly or nonhelical segments interspersed along the molecule with globular domains on each end (Type IV).
	* **Fibrillar Collagens** - assemble into rigid rope-like fibrils which can be packaged into thicker fibers.
	* They provide the insoluble framework for the mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix.
* **Proteoglycans** - a protein-polysaccharide complex which may be assembled into giant complexes. They form a porous, hydrated gel that occupies the extracellular space to *resist crushing forces.*
	* They are thought to have a role in cell-to-cell signaling.
* **Fibronectin** - consists of a linear array of distinct building blocks. They *facilitate the interactions between ECM components* and between cells and receptors.
	* Fibronectin also facilitates cell migration. Cells tend to migrate on fibronectin surfaces
	* Because they are made of building blocks, they tend to have a modular function.
* **Laminin** - glycoproteins which play a role in a cell's potential for migration, growth, and differentiation.
* **Integrins** - membrane proteins found in animal cells that play a key role in integrating extracellular and intracellular activities.
	* They can bind to ligands on the outside of the cell.
	* They can also interact with proteins within the cell to influence cellular activity.
	* Integrins usually lie in an inactive bent state, but when a specific ligand binds to them, they become straight and active. Thus, they act as *receptors*.
		*   **Inside Out Signaling** - cytoplasmic molecules induce a conformational change in the integrin. When multiple integrins are activated this way, the cell surface more strongly interacts with the extracellular ligands.
		* **Outside In Signals** - the integrin's extracellular domain binds to a ligand which induces a conformational change on its cytoplasmic side, triggering cytoplasmic proteins in the process.
		* They have the RGD sequence which helps many extracellular proteins bind to them.
# Extracellular Interactions
### Integrin-Based and Cell-ECM
* **Focal Adhesions** are dynamic structures that are assembled *when a cell makes contact with a surface and spreads itself.*
	* This plays a role in cell locomotion by creating mechanical forces or responding to such forces. It helps that the structure contains **actin** and **myosin**.
* **Hemidesmosomes** - contains a dense plaque on the inner surface of the plasma membrane with filaments coursing outward into the cytoplasm. Its filaments tend to consist of **keratin** and are thicker than focal adhesions.
	* The keratin **intermediate filaments** serve to support the cell. 
	* *They are linked to the ECM via integrins*.
### Cadherin-Based and Cell-Cell
* **Adherens junctions** - they involve cells held together by calcium-dependent linkages formed between the extracellular domains of cadherin molecules.
	* They connect the external environment to the actin cytoskeleton.
	* They provide a pathway for signals to be transmitted from the cell to the exterior of the cytoplasm
* **Desmosomes** - Disk shaped adhesive junctions, particularly found in tissues subject to mechanical stress. They contain cadherins that link two cells.
	* The cadherins involved in desmosome formation are called **desmogelins** and **desmocollins**. 
	* These cadherins *bind to each other in extracellular space, and are anchored to intermediate filaments in cytoplasmic space*.
# Interactions with Other Cells
* *Cells have shown the ability to recognize other cell surfaces, selectively adhering to some surfaces.* Animal tissue has shown the ability of cells to self-assemble into organized structures.
* Cell adhesion also allows for **transmembrane signaling** wherein information is transferred across the plasma membrane. This, in turn, influences cellular activity.
### Proteins involved in Cell Adhesion.
* **Selectins** - a family of integral membrane glycoproteins that recognize and *bind to a particular arrangement of sugars* in the oligosaccharides projecting from the surface of other cells.
	* The binding of selectins to sugars requires calcium.
* (Certain) **Immunoglobulins** - a family of proteins with modular construction that have a role in the immune system, but also facilitate *calcium independent cell-cell adhesion*. 
* (Certain) **Integrins** - some integrins mediate cell-cell adhesion by binding to proteins on other cells.
* **Cadherins** - a family of glycoproteins that *mediate calcium dependent cell-cell adhesion*..
	* They also transmit signals from the ECM to the cytoplasm. 
	* They tend to join cells of similar type to one another by binding to the same cadherins on the surface of the neighboring cell. *They are thought to be responsible for self-sorting of mixed aggregates*. 
		* They tend to associate laterally to form parallel dimers and making use of calcium ion bridges for rigidity.
		* They may undergo **interdigitation** where bonded cadherins configure like a zipper. *This gives the adhesion more rigidity*.
	* They tend to have a modular construction. 
	* **Catenins** in the cytosol tether the cadherins to the cytoskeleton, in addition to transmitting signals from the cytoplasm to the nucleus.
# Junctions
### Tight Junctions (zonulae occludens)
* Located on the apical end of the junctional complex between ajacent epithelial cells, 
* They block diffusion through the paracellular pathway (intracellular space) between cells.
	* That said, they are selectively permeable to some solutes and ions.
	* The junctions can also be used to hold water on one side of the cell sheet.
* It consists of paired rows of aligned integral member proteins forming continuous fibrils that forms a gasket around cells.
* They primarily consist of **claudins** and sometimes **occludins**. 
### Gap Junctions
* Specialized sites of communication between adjoining cells in animal cells.
* They are sites where the plasma membranes of adjacent cells come very close but not touching each other
* Contains ion channels that connect the cytoplasms of cells.
* They are composed entirely of **connexin** organized into complexes called **connexons** that span the membrane channel.
	* Connexons consist of a ring around an **annulus**. 
	* Connexons tend to be *clustered* in specific regions of the membrane which form plaques. As a result, *they connect many cells of a tissue together*.
* They are *relatively nonselective* compared to the plasma membrane's ion channels.  They can also be *gated* and *triggered by stimuli*.
* They allow cells to cooperate metabolically or respond synchronously from stimulation of a few cells in the network.
### Plasmodemsata
* Sites of communication between adjacent plant cells.
* Contains channels that connect the cytoplasm of cells to allow the passage of solutes.
* They are lined by plasma membrane and contain a dense central structure called the **desmotubule**.
	* The desmotubule is derived from the smooth endoplasmic reticulum of two cells.
* The plasmodesmata pore is *capable of dilation*, allowing large solutes to pass through.
* *Movement proteins* regulate the flow of proteins across the plasmodesmata.
### Tunneling Nanotubes
* Thin, highly elongated tubules that connect cells over long distances.
