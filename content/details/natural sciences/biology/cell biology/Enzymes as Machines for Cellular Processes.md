# Cellular Processes are not Spontaneous
* Within cells, *cellular processes are not necessarily thermodynamically favorable* (that is, they are endergonic). This might be because of more favorable structure. 
* There are two ways to carry out the processes within the cell even if they are endergonic
	* **By having more reactants**. In effect, this increases the equilibrium constant so that the forward reaction is favored. 
	* **By introducing additional energy**. This can be done by using common intermediates in metabolic processes and *coupling endergonic reactions with exergonic reactions* . 
	  
	  Usually, the common intermediate comes from ATP since the reaction of ATP Hydrolysis is more or less spontaneous. 
* *Metabolism relies on the cell not being in equilibrium*. Irreversible reactions drive metabolism forward, and the cell itself can obtain more reactants to maintain a  **steady state**.
# How do Enzymes Catalyze?
* On their own, cellular processes will take hundreds of thousands of years to complete. This requires *lowering activation energy*. 
	* A change in temperature. However, this has the effect of denaturing proteins and damaging cell structure.
	* Enzymes 
* Enzymes cause their substrates to be very reactive without requiring very high energy inputs. This is done by *binding to reactants more tightly when they are ready to be converted to products*. 
* The enzyme then performs any of the following:
	* **Reorienting** the substrates correctly facilitate the reaction
	* By altering the **electrostatic configuration** through the side chains in the enzyme through:
		* Having an environment within the enzyme that has a suitable pH (usually through the enzyme's cofactors).
		* By producing a temporary covalent bond between the enzyme and the substrate
		* By facilitating hydrolysis
	* By exerting a physical stress through an **induced fit** where the enzyme forces a change to allow the substrate to fit in the active sites. 
	  
	  In the process, the shape of the enzyme is changed to relieve the strain.

* Once the reaction proceeds, the enzyme has lower affinity for the products which are then expelled. 
* *Enzymes have high specificity*-- they only react to certain substrates.
# What Influences Enzyme Activity? 
* Under the **Michaelis-Metten Model** we can gather the following insights:
	* At low substrate concentrations, the amount of substrate limits the reaction rate since there are few substrates to carry out the reaction.
	* At high substrate concentrations, the amount of enzyme limits the reaction rate since all enzyme molecules are now being utilized with some substrates not being used. 
*  The presence of **inhibitors** that decrease the activity of the enzyme. 
	* **Irreversible inhibitors** bond very tightly to an enzyme and forms a covalent bond with one of its residues.
	* **Reversible inhibitors** bind to the enzyme loosely and are easily displaced
		* **Competitive inhibitors** compete for the substrate for access to the active site.
		  
		  They resemble the substrate and can bind to the enzyme, preventing the reaction by removing the reactants.
		* **Noncompetitive inhibitors** act as false active sites and bind to substrates.
		  
		  They resemble the active site and prevent the reaction by removing the catalyst. 

* Regulating enzyme activity has its own applications
	* Some toxins work under the principle of irreversibly inhibiting enzymes in the cell.
	* Drugs work by reversibly inhibiting certain enzymes to prevent certain reactions.
* *Enzyme activity can be altered in two ways*
	* **Covalent Modification** - the catalytic activity of the enzyme can be changed by modifying its conformation through transfering phosphate groups.
	* **Allosteric Modulation** - the catalytic activity of the enzyme cna be changed through compounds that bind to **allosteric sites**. This induces a ripple effect that alters the conformation of the active site.
		* Allosteric modulation can induce **feedback inhibition** by inhibiting the reaction when there is a surplus of byproducts.
