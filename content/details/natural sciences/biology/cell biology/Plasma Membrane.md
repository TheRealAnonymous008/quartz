* The **plasma membrane** is a thin and fragile membranous layer that separates the internals of the cell from the surroundings
# Composition
* The structure of most membranes consists of a **lipid bilayer** where the hydrophilic ends are directed outwards
	* The membrane is held together by a thin sheet of noncovalent bonds.
	* The bilayer prevents any water-soluble molecules from entering or leaving the cell.
	* The membrane's lipid bilayer primarily consists of **phosphoglycerides** but also larger **sphingolipids** and **cholesterols**.  
	* The membrane itself arises as a consequence of the lipid bilayer forming a thin film around the cell. Thus, they are *always continuous* but at the same time *easily deformable*.
	* *Lipid bilayers can self-assemble*. This is apparent in the formation of **liposomes**. 
	* The lipid bilayer is composed of two more or less stable monolayers that may have different physical and chemical properties. *The lipid composition of the lipid bilayer changes the properties of the cell and how other cells interact with it.*
* It also consists of various **membrane carbohydrates**. 
	* Typically these carbohydrates are various oligosaccharides. 
	* They play a role in mediating the interactions of a cell with its environment and sorting membrane proteins to different compartments.
	* Most of these carbohydrates are linked to proteins to form **glycoproteins**. These carbohydrates face away from the cytosol.
* Membranes also contain **membrane proteins** which serve different purposes. 
	* These are typically oriented in a specific way relative to the cytoplasm. Usually, this orientation is indicative of their purpose.
	* **Integral Proteins** are those that can penetrate the lipid bilayer. 
		* These tend to be amphipathic globular proteins 
		* Some integral proteins contain channels that can allow molecules to pass through.
		* Their transmembrane domains span the core of the lipid bilayer, often in a helical manner. They contain hydrophobic nonpolar molecules.
	* **Peripheral proteins** are those that are located entirely outside the lipid bilayer and noncovalently bonded to the membrane surface.
		* They usually function to make the membrane's skeleton, as special enzymes and coats, or transmission of transmembrane signals.
		* They can be recruited or released by the membrane as needed.
	* **Lipid Anchored proteins** are located outside but are covalently linked to a lipid molecule within the bilayer.
* *The Plasma membrane is usually not homogeneous*. Depending on its composition and structure, different parts of it can be used for different purposes even in the same cell. 
# Function
* Compartmentalization to separate a cellular component from its surroundings. 
	* Related to this is the fact that they help demarcate cells from their surroundings even after **cell fusion**.
* Scaffolds for enzymes and substrates to facilitate metabolic reactions.
* Transportation of molecules and solutes into and out of the cell (see [[#Movement Across Membranes]]). 
* Allows responses to stimuli in a process called **signal transduction**.  Ligands and kinases that facilitate these reactions may alter the internal activities of the cell.. 
* Allows **intracellular interaction** by adhering to each other and facilitating the transfer of signals and materials.
* Involved in **energy transduction** by containing the machinery for metabolic pathways. 
# Membrane Fluidity and Dynamics
* Membranes are characterized by their **fluidity**. At certain temperatures, the membrane will either be in a liquid or a gel like state.
* The fluidity of a membrane determines the movement of material across the lipid bilayer, and also the assembly of the membrane. 
* The **transition temperature** of a bilayer depends on the ability of the lipid molecules to be packed together based on their construction.  
	* The greater the unsaturation of fatty acids, the lower the temperature needed before the bilayer becomes a gel.
	* The shorter the fatty acid chains, the lower the melting temperature becomes.
* Cholesterols tend to increase the durability while decreasing the permeability of the membrane by creating regions of intermediate fluidity.
* *Maintenance of membrane fluidity is an example of homeostasis*. Cells can respond appropriately by changing the composition of the membrane (i.e., making it more cold or heat resistant). This is done via **desaturases** and **phospholipases**.
* **Lipid rafts** are self-assembled lipid membranes from sphingolipids and cholesterols that are more gel-like and highly ordered than the surrounding regions. 
	* They tend to float within the more fluid and disordered environment of an artificial bilayer.
	* Certain proteins become concentrated to these liquid rafts.
	* They have not been observed within natural cells, but are promising since they can introduce order in the lipid bilayer.
* *The most restrictive motion for a membrane lipid is to move from one membrane to another*
	* **Flippases** can facilitate this reaction much quicker.
	* The lateral movement of lipids allows the membrane to maintain a uniform distribution of them. 
	* The diffusion of proteins laterally along the membrane is mostly Brownian, although some proteins are immobile or move in a non-random direction as directed by other proteins.
	* Findings using optical tweezers suggest that *the plasma membrane is compartmentalized and contains "barriers"* within the cytoplasmic side which restricts movement of integral proteins
# Movement Across Membranes
* On their own, solutes prefer to **diffuse** from high to low concentrations due to entropy. 
* On their own, electrolytes prefer to diffuse based on an **electrochemical gradient** which accounts for the difference in charge and concentration of electrolyte on either side. 
### Passive Transport
* Passive transport can occur naturally as the solute passes through the bilayer.
	* The more soluble the solute is to a lipid, the faster the transport.
	* The smaller the molecule is the easier it will pass through the lipid bilayer
	* Uncharged, nonpolar molecules penetrate easier.
* **Osmosis** involves the transfer of solvents such as water through the membrane. In such a case, water the solvent moves towards the side with higher concentration (the hypertonic side).
	* *Osmosis and solute concentrations have an effect on the shape of the cell*. 
	* Cells in hypertonic solutions experience **turgid pressure** which causes them to bloat. 
	* Cells in hypotonic solutions experience shriveling, and in the case of plant cells **plasmolysis**.
	* Osmosis can be facilitated through integral proteins called **aquaporins** that act as small channels for water to travel through.
* **Ion Channels** are involved in the transport of ions since the plasma membrane is not permeable to most ions.
	* These ion channels are selective to a particular ion.
	* These ion channels can be **gated** that are open or closed based on different factors.
		* **voltage-gated** channels act based on differences in potential.
		* **ligand-gated** channels act based on ligands (distinct from the solute) clamping onto the channel
		* **mechano-gated** channels act based on physical forces (such as stretching the membrane)
* **Facilitated Diffusion** is diffusion which involves a facilitative transporter to which the solute binds to. The transporter then exposes the solute to the other side of the gradient because of a conformational change.
	* The transporters are usually enzymes and so are subjected to the limitations of enzymes.
	* This process can be regulated by the cell.
### Active Transport
* **Active transport** pertains to the use of integral membrane proteins (called **pumps**) to selectively move a solute across the membrane *using an energy input*.
* Active transport *usually involves complex conformational changes*. Thus, they are slower than passive transport.
* Some examples of pumps:
	* Sodium-Potassium ATP pump
	* P-type pumps 
	* V-type pumps.(V = Vacuole)
	* ATP-binding cassette transporters. 
	* Light-driven proton pumps
* **Cotransport** or secondary transport involves the use of gradients formed by active transport to transport solute. These reactions are facilitated by **cotransporters**.
	* A **symport** occurs when the ion and the solute move in the same direction 
	* An **antiport** occurs when the ion and solute move in opposite directions (i.e., they are exchanged).
# Membrane Potentials
* **Membrane Potentials** arise from *voltage differences inside and outside the plasma membrane* depending on the presence of cations and anions.
* Cells in an unexcited state are said to be at **resting potential**. However, if the cell receives a strong stimulus, it triggers **active potential** marked by a sharper potential gradient.
* These potentials are governed and maintained by active and passive transport mechanisms. 
	* In the resting state, most of these are closed so the flow of ions is minimal.
	* In the active state, all of these transport mechanisms are activated which causes *rapid depolarization to the point the potential flips sign*.
	* After these changes, the cell enters a **refractory period** during which it cannot be further stimulated because the sodium channels must close first before they can be reopened.
* The membrane potential can be calculated using the **Nernst Equation**.
