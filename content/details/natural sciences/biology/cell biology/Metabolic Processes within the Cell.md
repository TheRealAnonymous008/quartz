# What is Metabolism?
* **Metabolism** refers to the sum total of all chemical reactions that occur within the cell. These reactions occur in groups of **metabolic pathways** that can be classified into two kinds:
	* **Catabolic Pathways** that are always **exergonic** since they involve the breaking down of complex molecules to simpler molecules.
	* **Anabolic Pathways** that are always **endergonic** since they involve building complex molecules from simpler primitives.
* Pathways can also be divided based on whether or not they require oxygen (i.e., **aerobic** and **anaerobic** reactions).
* *Catabolic and anabolic pathways can be separated due to catabolic pathways being irreversible, and also because the same enzymes are involved in both pathways*
# What drives Metabolism?
* The main driver for metabolism in the cell is the *stripping of hydrogen molecules*. More Hydrogen means more energy. 
	* Usually **oxidation** reactions involve the release of energy
	* **Reduction** reactions involve the storage of energy
	* An important concept in metabolism is **transfer potential** wherein certain molecules with high transfer potential are better donors and those with low transfer potential are better acceptors. *The transfer potential is directly proportional to the amount of free energy the molecule has and inversely proportional to the affinity for the molecule being transferred to*.
* The initial stages that drive metabolic reactions in the cell are mostly the same across organisms -- **glycolysis** or the oxidation of glucose.
	* Reactions involved in glycolysis, as well as most catabolic pathways are essentially irreversible. This allows the reaction to be driven in the forward direction.
	* *This reaction is not truly spontaneous as the cell needs to invest one ATP to start the reaction*. However, the end result is more ATP than what the cell began with.
	* **Fermentation** is a related reaction wherein the cell creates intermediates that can be activated when Oxygen is introduced again. This allows the cell to regenerate its supply of NAD. 
* Energy that is produced via metabolic pathways is stored using **ATP** (Adenosine Triphosphate)
	* ATP synthesis entails a reduction-oxidation reaction that makes use of the cofactor NAD.
	* *ATP synthesis is regulated. It is inhibited when energy is at a surplus*. This is driven by the fact that the ATP / ADP supply of the cell is limited. 
* **NAD** is a cofactor that is involved in many reduction-oxidation reactions. It is a high energy compound that drives metabolic reactions through donating high energy electrons.
	* A related compound is **NADPH** which can be used to measure how much energy the cell has in store. *When energy is abundant, the production of NADPH is favored*.  This is the cofactor used by enzymes with a reductive role in anabolic pathways. *This allows for the growth of the cell*.
	* Another is **NADP**. *When energy is scarce, the production of NADP is favored*. This is the cofactor used by enzymes with a dehydrogenase role in catabolic pathways. *This allows the cell to store the energy as ATP*.
