* The **cortex** of a cell is an active region beneath the plasma membrane. 
	* It is responsible for ingesting extracellular materials, extension during cell movements and constriction duiring cell division.
* Actin undergoes **treadmilling** where it is assembled on one end and disassembled on another end.
# Actin
* Thinner **actin**-based structures organized into  branching networks.
	* Actin is responsible for extracellular and intracellular motile processes such as moving the cell around a medium or moving vesicles and performing phagocytosis.
	* Actin also plays a role in determining cell shape and provides structural support.
* An actin filament is a *two-stranded structure with two helical grooves* running along its length
	* It has a barbed structure with a positive and a negative end. This arises because all the monomers within an actin filament are pointed in the same direction.
* Actin is an ATPase so its assembly involves ADP. The assembly of the filament relies on the *concentration of ATP and actin*.
* Has the motor protein **myosin**
	* These molecules tend to move towards the barbed end of an actin filament.
	* **Conventional / Type II Myosins** are the primary motors for muscle contraction but they are also used for splitting a cell during cell division, generating tension at focal adhesions, and cell migration.
		* Type II myosins tend to assemble so that the ends of their tails point towards the center of the filament and the globular heads point away. 
		* This results in a bipolar filament which can pull actin filaments towards one another.
	* **Unconventional Myosins** are smaller and unable to assemble into filaments in vivo. They instead operate as individual protein molecules.
		* These myosins move in a hand-over-hand molecule similar to kinesins.
		* **Myosin VI** is unique in that it moves to the pointed end of an actin filament.
# Actin-Binding Proteins
* These proteins give the actin filament structure for a particular purpose.
* They affect the localized assembly or disassembly of the actin filaments, their properties, and their interactions with one another.
* **Nucleating Proteins** - responsible for speeding up the nucleation or formation of the actin filament.
	* **Arp 2/3** - actin-related proteins that scaffolds the formation of actin, generating networks of branched actin filaments
	* **Formins** - generate unbranched filaments found in focal adhesions. They also promote rapid elongation of filaments.
	* **Spire** - binds multiple actin monomers to form an actin nucleus.
* **Monomer Sequestering Proteins** - prevents the near complete polymerization of soluble actin monomers into filaments. 
	* This regulates the concentration of actin depending on whether or not polymerization / depolymerization is favored. 
	* **Thymosins** - prevents actin-ATP monomers from polymerizing.
* **Capping Proteins** - regulates the length of actin filaments by forming a cap that blocks loss and gain of subunits.
* **Monomer-binding Proteins**  - allows for the polymerization of actin monomers into filaments.
	* **Profilin** - promotes the growth of actin filaments. 
* **Depolymerization Proteins** - These proteins allow depolymerization, allowing for dynamic changes in cytoskeletal structure
	* **Cofilins** - fragments actin filaments and promotes depolymerization at the pointed ends.
* **Cross-Linking Proteins** - alters the 3D organization of actin filaments.
	* Examples: **Filamins, Villins, Fimbrin** 
* **Filament-Severing Proteins** - binds to the side of an existing filament and breaks it in two. They may either promote incorporation of actin monomers or cap the fragments they generate.
* **Membrane-Binding Proteins** - Proteins that link the filaments to the plasma membrane by attaching to a plasma membrane indirectly. These control the contractile, expanding motion of the cell.
	* Examples: **Vinculin, Ezrin, Radixin, Moesin, Spectrins**.
