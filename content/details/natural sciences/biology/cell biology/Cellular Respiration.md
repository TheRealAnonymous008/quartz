* All Cellular Respiration processes begin with glycolysis to form pyruvate and NADH.
* *The synthesis of energy is driven by establishing ion gradients*
# Aerobic Respiration
* Pyruvate molecules formed are transported into the inner mitochondrial membrane to form **Acetyl CoA.**
* Acetyl CoA is then fed into the  **Tricarboxylic Acid** Cycle (a.k.a. the Krebs cycle or the citric acid cycle).
	* This metabolic pathway involves metabolites found in the cell's other catabolic pathways.
	* *All of the cell's energy providing molecules get broken down to metabolites of the TCA cycle*.
	* This reaction produces the coenzymes $\text{FADH}_2$ and $\text{NADH}$ which facilitate the formation of $\text{ATP}$ via **Oxidative Phosphorylation**. 
* Molecules such as **$2,4$-dinitrophenol** uncouple ADP phosphorylation and glycolysis, effectively inhibiting ATP production.
	* These molecules act as proton pumps which stabilizes the proton gradient.
# Electron Transport Chain
* **ATP synthesis** is performed using the coenzymes.
	* This is done by using the high energy electrons from $\text{FADH}_2$ and $\text{NADH}$ in the **Electron Transport Chain**. 
	* Due to the ETC, protons are pumped outward across the inner mitochondrial membrane forming a **proton electrochemical gradient** .
		* The force that is produced by this gradient is called the **proton motive force**.
			* Aside from ATP synthesis, it also helps in moving around ADP and P in and out of the mitochondrion.
			* It also helps in pumping calcium ions.
		* The exact contribution of concentration and voltage to the proton motive force depends on the permeability of the inner membrane.
	* Protons are then moved back across the membrane which drives the formation of ATP.
	* *This process is analogous to stretching a rubber band to store and then release energy*.
* The Electron Transport chain contains five types of membrane-bound electron carriers. *Electrons lose energy as they travel across the chain*.
	* Flavoproteins 
	* Cytochromes - proteins with heme groups.
	* Copper Atoms
	* Ubiquinone
	* Iron-sulfur proteins
* The ETC contains four complexes based on the above carriers.
	* Complex I - NADH Dehydrogenase
	* Complex III - Cytochrome $bc_1$
	* Complex II - Succinate Dehydrogenase
	* Complex IV - Cytochrome $c$ oxidase
* *The final electron recipient in the Electron Transport Chain is $O_2$*.
# Why do Proton Gradients drive ATP synthesis?
* One hypothesis is called the **binding change mechanism**
	* The energy released by the movement of protons is not used to drive ADP phosphorylation directly but principally to *change the binding affinity of the active site* for the ATP product so that ATP can be released. 
	* Each active site in ATP synthase progresses successively through three distinct conformations that have different affinities for substrates and product.
	* ATP is synthesized by rotational catalysis in which one part of the ATP synthase rotates relative to another part. The rotation itself is driven by proton movement.
