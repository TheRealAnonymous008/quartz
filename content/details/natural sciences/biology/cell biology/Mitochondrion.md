# Mitochondrial Structure
* The mitochondria probably [[The Properties of Life from a Biological Perspective#Endosymbiont Theory|arose]] from an aerobic bacterium that was ingested by an anaerobic host cell 
* *Mitochondria can fuse into one another or split into two*. 
* They are often associated with fatty acid-containing oil droplets from which they derive materials to be oxidized.
### Membranes
* An **outer boundary membrane** which encloses the mitochondrion. Generally, this has a lot of lipids and contain **porins**.
* The **inner boundary membrane** that forms a double-layer membrane with the outer membrane. Generally, this has a lot of proteins, is devoid of cholesterol and rich in **cardiolipin**.
	* The permeability of this membrane is important in maintaining the protein gradient. *If it is more permeable, it loses more energy to heat*.
	* This is also the site of **ATP Synthase**.
		* ATP synthase consists of two parts--one which hydrolyzes ATP and another which conducts protons from the intermembrane space to the matrix.
		* *ATP synthase is effectively a rotary motor*.
* The **intermembrane space** is the space between the outer and inner membrane.
* The **cristae** which consist of folded membranous sheets that act to increase the surface area of the mitochondrion.
* The **cristae junctions** which join the inner boundary with the cristae.
### Matrix
* The **matrices** are interior compartments located within the mitochondrion. 
* These have a gel-like consistency due to high concentration of water-soluble proteins.
* These also contain ribosomes and **mitochondrial DNA and RNA**.
	* These facilitate the manufacturing of the most hydrophobic proteins of the inner membrane.
# Functions
* ATP production and metabolism. 
* Sites of synthesis for various substances. 
* Regulation of ion concentrations within the cytosol.
* Proteins in the intermembrane space facilitate cell suicide.
# Human Impact
* Abnormalities in the mitochondria typically result in muscle or brain degradation. These tissue consume a lot of ATP.
	* This may result in other conditions such as abnormal muscle fibers or loss of senses.
	* Interestingly, these conditions are inherited maternally.
* The flow of the electron transport chain also contributes to free radicals within the cell which causes mitochondrial DNA to be more susceptible to mutation. *These might constitute premature aging, but not be relevant for normal aging.*
