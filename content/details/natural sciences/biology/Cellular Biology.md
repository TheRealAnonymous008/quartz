* Life possibly came as a product of [[Complex Systems|emergent behavior]], as shown by the [Miller-Urey Experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millerâ€“Urey_experiment) It is interesting to try simulating life and all the processes that gave rise to it. 
	* Related to this is the importance of self-assembly in biological processes
	* Life cannot exist under equilibrium.

* Protein Folding is fascinating considering it only arises from the amino acids encoded in the DNA. Interestingly, it is also subject to natural selection and sometimes self-assembly such that a particular protein performs a particular purpose based on its structure. 

* Engineering new proteins that can carry out virtually any chemical reaction is an interesting possibility for the future.

* Enzymes are basically small biological machines.
* Protein gradients drive ATP synthase like a water wheel, which then facilitates energy synthesis.
