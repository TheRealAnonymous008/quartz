* Good Scientists follow [[Bayesian Statistics]]. Update scientific theories based on evidence that is observed.

* *Science is more than the Scientific Method.* It is a mindset that involves constantly observing the world, and trying to explain the unexpected with scientific theory. 

* *No scientific law can ever be proven*. First principles themselves are assumptions about the world. We can, however, refute our assumptions through testing.

*  *The test of all knowledge is experiment*. Experiment is the sole judge of scientific “truth.”

* Experiment, itself, helps to produce scientific laws laws, in the sense that it gives us hints. But also needed is [[Creativity|imagination]] to create from these hints the great generalizations

* **[Feynman's Atomic Hypothesis](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_01.html)** - *The most  important hypothesis that condenses as much information from Natural Science as possible*  --  all things are made of atoms—little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another.  

* All observations and measurements we make are based on a (technically arbitrary) standard that everyone has agreed upon.
