# Newton's Laws
* **Newton's First Law of Motion**. An object acted on by no external [[Kinds of Forces|force]] has a constant velocity and zero acceleration. 
	* *Forces are not required to sustain motion*. 
	* Forces can perturb an already existing motion.
	* An object is in **mechanical equilibrium** when $\vec F_\text{net} = 0$. Such an object has constant velocity
	* This law is valid within an **inertial frame of reference**. 
		* Any frame of reference that moves relative to an inertial frame of reference with constant velocity is also inertial.
		* Newton's First Law means that no inertial observer is privileged over another -- between two inertial observers, there is no way to say which observer is in motion or not. *There is no absolute standard rest*.
	* The inertial characteristics of an object is characterized by its **(inertial) [[Mass]]** - the tendency of an object to change its motion

* **Newton's Second Law of Motion**. If a net external force acts upon an object, the object accelerates in the direction of the net external force. This follows
  
  $$
  \vec{F}_\text{net} = m\vec{a}
  $$
	* Another way to write this is with [[Impulse and Momentum|momentum]]
	  $$
	  \vec{F}_\text{net} = \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}
	  $$
	* *Only the forces acting on an object determine its motion*.
	* $m\vec{a}$ is not a force but a net force. 

* **Newton's Third Law of Motion**.  If $A$ exerts a force on $B$ (an action), then $B$ also exerts an equal and opposite force n $A$ (a reaction).
  
  $$
  \vec F_\text{A on B} = -\vec{F}_\text{B on A}
  $$
	* *Action reaction does not imply causal relationships*. 
	* This is applicable regardless of how $A$ and $B$ are moving.
	* *The two forces in the equation are for two different objects*. It does not imply any form of motion, it only relates action-reaction pairs.
