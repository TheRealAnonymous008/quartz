* The **mass** of an object is an intrinsic property of that object.
	* The **inertial mass** is the object's resistance to being accelerated by [[Newtonian Mechanics|a force]].
	* The **active gravitational mass** is the strength of the gravitational field generated by an object.
	* The **passive gravitational mass** measure the gravitational force exerted on an object in a known gravitational field. 

# Center of Mass
* Consider a system of $n$ points, where each point has mass $m_i$, $1 \le i\le n$ located with coordinates $r_i$. The **center of mass** is the point on space $R$ such that
  $$
  R= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n{m_ir_i}}{\sum_{i=1}^n m_i}
  $$

* If the distribution of mass is continuous with density function $\rho(r)$ within solid $Q$ where $r\in \mathbb{R}^n$, then the center of mass is given by
  $$
  R = \frac{1}{M}\int^{(n)}_Q \rho (r) \ r \ dV 
  $$
  Where $\int^{(n)}_Q$ denotes an [[Integral Calculus|iterated integral]] over the solid $Q$. 
  
  In three dimensions this gives 
  $$
  R = \frac{1}{M} \iiint_Q \rho (r) \ r dV
  $$
* The center of mass is the [[Random Variables and Probability Distributions|average]] position weighted by the mass at each point.

# Moment of Inertia
* Consider a system of $n$ points where each point has mass $m_i$ and distance from the origin point $\vec{r}_i$. The **moment of inertia** is defined as
  $$
  I = \sum_{i} m_i r_i^2 
  $$
  If the distribution of mass is continuous with density function $\rho(r)$ within solid $Q$ where $r\in \mathbb{R}^n$, then the center of mass is given by
  $$
  I = \int_Q^{(n)} \rho(r) \ ||r||^2 \ dV
  $$
  Where $\int^{(n)}_Q$ denotes an [[Integral Calculus|iterated integral]] over the solid $Q$. 
  
  In three dimensions this gives
  $$
  \iiint_Q \rho(x,y,z) ||r||^2 \ dV
  $$

* It is an analogue for center of mass but for rotations.


* The **Parallel Axis Theorem** states that the moment of inertia of a body about an axis through its center of mass $I_\text{cm}$ and the moment of inertia about any other axis parallel to the original axis, denoted $I_P$ is related by
  
  $$
  I_p = I_\text{cm} + Md^2 
  $$
  Where $d$ is the distance between the two parallel axes.  
	* *Intuition*: We can recalculate the moment of inertia using an integration over slices about the axis through point $P$ . Recalculating and regrouping terms gives us $I_p$ in terms of $I_\text{cm}$
	* *This allows us to reframe rotation problems with an axis of rotation passing through the moment of inertia.*
