* **Periodic Motion / Oscillation** concerns any kind of motion that repeats itself over and over.
* An object undergoing periodic motion always has a stable equilibrium position. When it is perturbed, it is pulled towards equilibrium by a restoring force or torque, overshoots and then cycles back to equilibrium.

* The **amplitude** of the motion $A$ is the maximum magnitude of displacement from equilibrium.
* A **cycle** is defined to be one trip from $A$ to $-A$ and back to $A$. 
* The **period** $T$ is the time to complete one cycle. The **frequency** $f$ is the number of cycles in a unit of time. By definition
  $$
  T =\frac{1}{f}
  $$
* The **angular frequency** $\omega$ is defined as
  $$
  \omega = 2\pi f = \frac{2\pi }{T}
  $$
