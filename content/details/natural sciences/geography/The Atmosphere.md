* The **Atmosphere** is a thin layer of gas that surrounds the Earth's surface.
# Composition of the Atmosphere
### Atmospheric Layers
* **Troposphere** - the lowest layer of the atmosphere which contains breathable air, and aspects of weather. 
* **Stratosphere** - contains a stratified temperature gradient where lower altitudes are cooler. This layer also contains the **Ozone Layer**.
* **Mesosphere**  - the coldest part of the atmosphere. 
* **Thermosphere** - the hottest layer of the atmosphere due to the particles here absorbing the Sun's energy
* These layers are separated with breaks called **pauses**.
* The atmosphere is held together due to the *gravity* pulling down the gases to Earth and the natural *buoyancy* of its constituent gases. 
	* The pull of gravity also explains why higher atmospheric layers contain less particles  *Lighter gases also exist higher up in the atmosphere* .
	* This also explains the fact that the higher layers have lower pressures due to having fewer molecules.
* The height of the troposphere is influenced by insolation. It is higher near the equator and lower near the poles.
### Materials found in the Atmosphere
* The atmosphere is predominantly made of *aerosols* which consist of gases, solid particulates, and liquid droplets.
* The majority of the atmosphere is *Nitrogen* and *Oxygen*.
* The solid particulates in the atmosphere primarily consist of dust and salt particles blown by the wind. 
# The Atmosphere and Insolation
* Some atmospheric components can partially **reflect** incoming insolation. This reflected energy can be returned to space or be contained within the atmosphere.
* Some components can **absorb** energy which increases the temperature of the component. 
* Some components can **scatter** atmospheric components which diffuse the energy in various directions. 
	* The sky is blue because the *atmosphere tends to scatter blue light*
	* The sun appears yellow because the *atmosphere tends to allow red and green light through* .
	* *When the sun is at a low angle, the insolation has to pass through more of the atmosphere.*. This is why sunrises and sunsets appear red or orange. 
* The atmospheric layers interact with insolation differently.
	* *The thermosphere intercepts high energy electromagnetic waves* such as X-rays and gamma rays, which causes the layer to warm up at the parts closest to space (although it remains relatively cold because of the sparse number of atoms).
	* *The stratosphere contains the Ozone Layer which absorbs UV light*. Like with the thermosphere, this causes the stratosphere to heat up at higher altitudes.
	* The temperature gradient for the other layers can generally be seen as a consequence of *the sun heating the surface more, and the surface heating the atmosphere from below*.
* *Clouds also help in intercepting insolation*. The amount of energy that is reflected by clouds varies because of their composition, location, and season.
# The Ozone Layer
* *The Ozone Layer contains a recyclable amount of Ozone* It is recyclable since sunlight that hits an ozone molecule causes it to disassociate into $O_2$ and $O$. The latter atom can simply recombine with another $O_2$ molecule. 
* *Ozone concentration is typically low over the Equator and in regions with low insolation*. The former is because of wind patterns in the stratosphere that are directed to the poles and the latter is because insolation is required for the reformation of Ozone.
	* Of note, *Antarctica has an ozone hole above it*. This is because of circumpolar winds due to being surrounded by water.
	* By contrast, the *Arctic has high concentrations of Ozone*. This is because it is an ocean surrounded by continents which induces the appropriate wind patterns to bring ozone towards the Arctic.
* The Ozone layer effectively shields the surface from UV light by *acting as a regenerative buffer that can absorb the energy from UV*. 
* *Human activity has accelerated the depletion of Ozone*. This has caused a hole in the ozone layer.
