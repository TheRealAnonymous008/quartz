1. There are three states of being. 
   * **Not knowing** - where we are unaware or lack knowledge, but are still curious
   * **Action** - where we take effort to change our state of not knowing. 
   * **Completion** - The state of not knowing is transformed to knowing by our action. We learned something new.


2. Accept that everything is a draft. It helps to get it done.
	* What you are doing is not perfect. It will never be perfect, even after it is done.


3. There is no editing stage.
	* When you release something to the world, it is final and can never be taken back. Don't tweak what you have made, make another one.


4. Pretending you know what you’re doing is almost the same as knowing what you are doing, so just accept that you know what you’re doing even if you don’t and do it.


5. Banish procrastination. If you wait more than a week to get an idea done, abandon it.
	* If you are not feeling the current idea, try the next idea instead.


6. The point of being done is not to finish but to get other things done.


7. Once you’re done you can throw it away.


8. Laugh at perfection. It’s boring and keeps you from being done.


9. People without dirty hands are wrong. Doing something makes you right.
	* Listen to the people who are in your field instead.


10. Failure counts as done. So do mistakes.
	* Failure shows that you've tried. Success teaches us nothing.


11. Destruction is a variant of done.


12. If you have an idea and publish it on the internet, that counts as a ghost of done.
	* If you can't do it, share the idea so that it finds the way to someone who can.
	* At the end of the day, if you want to see something happen, the practical approach is to let experienced and passionate people work on these ideas.


13. Done is the engine of more.
