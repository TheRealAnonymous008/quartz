# Callois' Typology of Ludic Activities
* **Agon** - competitive play. Combat is artificially created and adversaries confront each other.
* **Alea** - chance based play. All games that are based on a decision independent of the player.
* **Mimicry** - role playing and make-believe play. One becomes an illusory character. The play of representation
* **Ilinx** - playing with the physical sensation, with the goal of momentarily destroying the stability of perception.
* **Paida** - wild, free-from improvisational play. 
* **Ludus** - rule bound, regulated formalized play.

# Leblanc's Typology of Fun 
* **Sensation** - games as sense pleasure
* **Fantasy** - games as make-believe
* **Narrative** - games as drama
* **Challenge** - games as an obstacle course.
* **Fellowship** - games as a social framework.
* **Discovery** - games as uncharted territory.
* **Expression** - games as self-discovery
* **Submission** - games as masochism -- the pleasure of submitting to the formal system.
# Apter's Typology of Fun 
* **Exposure to Arousing Stimulation** - intense and overwhelming sensation.
* **Fiction and Narrative** - emotional arousal from character identification
* **Challenge** - difficulties and frustrations arising from competition.
* **Exploration** - moving off into new territory.
* **Negativism** - deliberate rule-breaking.
* **Cognitive Synergy** - imaginative play.
* **Facing Danger** - risk within the protective framework of play.

# Sutton-Smith's Typology
* Within the system of social relationships, *players can assume a variety of roles*.  Players may be actors or counteractors
* *Play emerges directly from the relationships between players*.
* Sutton-Smith gives the following motives and what the actors / counter-actors perform:
	* **Race** - to overtake / stay ahead
	* **Chase** - to catch / elude
	* **Attack** - to overpower / defend
	* **Capture** - to take / avoid being taken
	* **Harassment** - to tease, taunt or lure / to see through, move suddenly, or bide time.
	* **Search** - to find / to hide
	* **Rescue** - to spring prisoner / to guard against escape
	* **Seduction** - to tempt another forbidden action / to resist.

# Bartle's Player Typology  
* Another typology from Bartle, applicable especially in MUDs. 
	* **Achievers** - have the goal of point-gathering and rising in levels.
	* **Explorers** - delight in having the game expose its internal machinations to them.
	* **Socializers** - to them, the game is a common backdrop that facilitates interaction with others.
	* **Killers** - impose themselves on others. 

# Typology by Age 
* All play activities are connected to childhood. Childhood is centered around play. To create games for a particular age, *you must speak the language of their childhood.*
