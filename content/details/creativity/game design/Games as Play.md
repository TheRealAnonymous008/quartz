* **Play** - pertains to the Experiential Systems of the game. It only occurs as players experience the [[Games as Rules|rules]] of the game in motion.
* The structure of a digital game space always grows directly from the *formal system* that defines the game. However, the space that a player experiences is also a function of *representation* (how the space is displayed) and *interaction* (how the player navigates the space).
* In understanding how games construct meaning, we are addressing the deeply felt ways that players engage with games and the emotional and social realities games reflect and construct.
# What is Play?
* ***Play** is free movement within a more rigid structure*. As an expression of the system, we take advantage of the space of possibility given by the system's structure.
	* *Play both exists because of and opposes rigid structures*.
*  [[Rules of Play -- Game Design Fundamentals by Salen and Zimmerman|Salen and Zimmerman]] provide a broad typology of three possible descriptors (from narrowest to broadest)
	* **Game Play** - the formalized interaction that occurs when players follow the rules of a game and experience its system through play
		* [[The Fundamentals of Game Design|Games are a subset of play. Play is an element of games]].
	* **Ludic Activities** - play activities that include not only games, but also non-game behaviors we think of as playing. We may categorize them as follows according to [[Players and Why We Play Games#Callois' Typology of Ludic Activities|Callois' Typology]]
	* **Being Playful** - the idea of being in a playful state of mind. 
		* *Play is latent in every human activity*. You can take inspiration for play behavior and contexts anywhere. 
* **Transformative Play**  - a special case of play that occurs when the free movement of play alters the more rigid structure in which it takes shape.
	* *Whether or not play is transformative depends on how we look at the system -- that is, which elements actually change*. 
	* Every instance of play carries with it the seeds of transformative play. Thus *maximize play for your participants at every possible moment*. 
# Games as Experiential Systems
### Play of Experience
* *To play a game is to experience the game*. Experience implies participation -- the player as a part of the game system.
* Sutton-Smith's model of the experience of games.
	* **Visual Scanning** - visual perception.
	* **Auditory discriminations** - listening for game events and signals.
	* **Motor responses** - physical action.
	* **Concentration** - intense focus on play.
	* **Perceptual patterns of learning** - coming to know the structure of the game itself.
* Experience come from the relationships between inputs, outputs, and internal player mechanisms. 
	* *Identifying the qualities of play you wish the players to experience is a useful way to frame game design problems*.
	* Game designers indirectly design player experience by designing the rules.
* Every game has a **core mechanic** which is the essential play activity players perform repeatedly in a game.
	* *The core mechanic contains the experiential building blocks of player interactivity*. 
	* If a game simply isn't fun to play, it is often the core mechanic that is the problem.
	* We may design the core mechanic by [[Creativity|breaking the rules]] or by taking inspiration from other core mechanics and varying them.
	* Remember, the core mechanic should facilitate meaningful play.
* *Game designers create activities for players* . Ask yourself what the player is actually doing when playing the game.

### Play of Pleasure
* *A game is a space in which a player's emotions and sense of desire undergoes manipulation and coercion*. 
	* This means translating the formal rules into an engaging experience of play.
	* Players accept rules not to restrict pleasure but to maximize them. 
* *Games are autotelic* Every game implicitly asserts the premise that the value of the game is intrinsic, and separate from the real world. The goals of a game are non-utilitarian and artificial.
	* *Playing the game is in itself the reward. We play for the sake of playing*.
	* Games must provide their own motivations and pleasures. After all *Why play a game that isn't fun?*.
* When play starts, players are first seduced into entering the [[The Fundamentals of Game Design|magic circle]]. Then, they are seduced into continuing to play.
	* Designers create not just the game, but *the ways players enter the game*. This is a hurdle as players must do things that lie on the border of the circle before they can enter.
	* In considering this seduction, we must consider all the formal, social, and cultural factors that contribute to experience.
* *What is fun is a complex phenomenon*. But, we have the following typologies of pleasures to understand it.
	* [[Players and Why We Play Games#Apter's Typology of Fun|Apter]] and [[Players and Why We Play Games#Leblanc's Typology of Fun|Leblanc's]] typologies can be used to analyze what is "fun" 
	* Callois' Typology also applies.

* We may also *consider the [[Flow State Model]]*. Ideally, we aim to achieve a flow state, something which games tend to produce because *meaningful play creates flow. Flow is one indicator of meaningful play.*. 

* **Same but different** principle [^1]. A game provides the same consistent structure each time but a different experience every time it is played.
	* Transformative play can help with this. Through repetition, play itself changes. 

* *Entertainment is the process of falling into a patterned activity*. If entertainment is a form of pleasure, it is a pleasure at once structural and exponential. It is the experience of the same-but-different.
* *The goal of the game is the main driver for pleasure*. 
	* Within the game the goal takes on enormous importance, but the goal itself as a formal construct is not the point: t*he goal is important only insofar as it serves to shape a player's experience*
	* The micro-interactions / short-term goals that move a player through a game are also important for player experience -- to *sustain interest and desire*.
	* *Games can also encourage players to conceive and achieve goals, giving them a sense of control*. They key is to let players know what to expect, teach them the systems, and make them feel in control.

* *Games can condition pleasure* by encouraging or discouraging certain behaviors.
* More than just shaping good and bad behaviors, *rewards and punishments shape a player's sense of pleasure* and overall play experience
	* **Rewards of Glory** - have no impact on the gameplay, but will be things that they end up taking away from the experience.
	* **Rewards of Sustenance** - given so player can maintain their avatar's status quo. 
	* **Rewards of Access** - allows a player access to new locations that were previously inaccessible.
	* **Rewards of Facility** - allows a player's avatar to do things they couldn't do before, opening up new strategies.
* Also consider *scheduling when rewards / punishments* are given.
	* Consider having a fixed schedule for punishment.
	* Consider having variable schedules for positive reinforcement.
	* *It is the rewards that sustain players throughout a game*. 
* No challenge = no game conflict to struggle against = no pleasure emerging from the process of overcoming the challenge.
	* Challenge while maintaining flow can be achieved by making the game *easy to learn, difficult to master*. 
		* If the game is too easy, there is no challenge and players will get bored. 
		* If the game is too hard, the player is not confident in their skills, and the players will get anxious.
	* *Boredom indicates dead space* -- where there is not enough choices in the game
	* *Anxiety indicates learned helplessness* -- the player feels like that no matter what choice they make, bad things happen. The game feels arbitrary.

* *Meaningful play can become addictive* -- players engrossed in the game want to play again.
	* A game that is addictive is indicative of meaningful play [^2]
	* When a game becomes pathologically addictive, there is no longer any play -- players are compelled to play rather than being free to move in the structure of the game.

[^1]: This applies to most things [[Creativity#General Principles|Creativity]] as well.
[^2]: Debatable if we're using the conventional definitions of addiction considering a game can be psychologically manipulative instead. But good games can be addictive too.  However what the authors mean by this is the positive dimension of addiction

### Play of Meaning
* *Games take place within a representational universe. To play a game is to interact with representations the game generates*
	* *Games can represent* by creating narrative, ideas or behavior. Items in the game universe gain meaning within the universe, and these meanings are experienced through play.
	* *Games are representations*. They represent something simulated.
* The complexity of game systems means that the representations that generate meaning can also be complex -- generating *many meanings at once*.
	* The meaning of the signs present in the game can only be understood in the context of the larger whole -- in the context of the game's meaning.
	* Meaning in a game sets up complex representational loops, generating *representations that affect and are affected by player interaction.*
	* *Meaning emerges from play*.

* Games create meaning through the interplay of system and context. In other words, *Meaning is [[Games as Rules#Emergent Systems|emergent]]*. 
	* Actions and outcomes are important. As players experience them, they develop rules about the game's universe. *Context establishes what actions mean*. 
	* *When the meaning of an action is unclear or ambiguous, meaningful play breaks down*
	* Structure and context organize what signs mean but also how they are used..

* In the play of meaning, *movement occurs both between signs and contexts.*
* Consider the **cognitive frame** -- they create contexts and interpretations that affect how we look at the world.
	* The frame of a game communicates that those contained it are playing. *We delineate play with the magic circle*.

* **Metacommunication** - play not only grants distinctive meanings in actions, but also communicates an attitude towards those actions
	* Thus, to play is to continually communicate the idea that play actions are just play and not something else.
	* *Play is metacommunication*. We reframe events so that actions of play are related to but not the same as other actions of not play.

* Games facilitate complex representation systems, and yet players experience them simply -- they do not have to think about things as being "for play". They just experience play itself.

### Narrative Play
* *Games create possibility spaces that provide compelling problems within an overarching narrative, afford creative opportunities for dealing with these problems and then respond to player choices with meaningful consequences*.
* There are three ways to think of this:
	* [[Narrative]] is used for everything
	* Games feature narrative introductions and backstories to put a game into context.
	* Games use narrative techniques and other tools for crafting narrative experiences.
* There are two structures we can use to understand the narrative components of a game.
	* **Embedded narrative** -  Players can experience the narrative as a crafted story interactively told. 
		* This tends to be in line with linear story telling
		* Tends to operate on the macro scale (a game would be not meaningful if gameplay itself is linear)
	* **Emergent Narrative** Players can engage with narrative as an emergent experience that happens while the game is played
		* This is in line with non-linear story-telling.
		* They can also be found in the moment-to-moment gameplay influenced by player choice 
		* or even as representations of game objects (strategies, game items, rules) that the players have formulated for themselves.
		* This is unique to games because games are systems, and as a result *they come from the formal structures of the game*.

	* *The game's narrative comes from a balance between embedded and emergent elements*. 
	* Mission / Episodic story structures are used because the game designer can control the larger narrative while giving the player agency for emergent narrative.

* Another fundamental element is *the goal of the game* that describes the nature of the player's interaction with the narrative context. 
	* Completion of the game's levels translate to [[Plot Structure|story beats]]. 
	* As players struggle towards the goal, [[Plot|conflict]] arises which contextualizes and motivates the player's actions.
		* *Games must have elements that oppose the player*.
	* Introduce uncertainty to add narrative tension. 

* Use narrative and tie it with the formal game structure itself (for example tie conflict with moment-to-moment gameplay.)
	* If moment-to-moment play is narrative play, we should pay attention to exactly what players are doing in the game, how their choices are represented, and how they fit the larger narrative. 
	* *Games are not just plot, but activities that the player goes through. Hence, design what these activities are (the core mechanic) and fit them to the narrative context.*

* *The space occupied by the game creates narrative* -- the characters are the game objects. The space is the context. The space patterns narrative experience over time for the player.

* A **narrative descriptor** is any component that participates in the game's system of representation.
* *Everything in a game is potentially a narrative descriptor*. Elements inside and outside of a game communicate a story.
	* However, written descriptors for narrative are not always effective in creating a clear context for interaction, especially when they are disconnected from player interaction.
	* Sometimes, narrative descriptors simply provide a more general narrative genre.
	* They serve (1) to identify objects or events, and (2) to provide frameworks for interaction.

* *Well designed games have many narrative descriptors to orient the player*. This is even if a player skips some of them.
	* *Important*: Never assume the player will carefully examine every narrative descriptor. Make the story come alive through the gameplay itself. 

* *[[#Play of Meaning|Representations]] in games do not exist in isolation from [[Games as Culture|culture]]*. Conventions exist in particular narrative [[Genre|genre]] that guide player expectations.
	* As cultural representations, game narratives have two components: **fictive worlds** -- the narrative context; and **story events** - the actual game incidents within the world.
	* *Fictive worlds and story events shape each other.*

* Narrative descriptors imply representational logic that constraints the design of the game to follow the setting described by the game.
	* **Ludonarrative dissonance** - a dissonance between gameplay and narrative.
	* Even when breaking the rules of narrative genre, games must incorporate this rule-breaking in a coherent way.

* *Meaningful narrative play follows from bridging the formal system with the player experience* .

* **Cutscenes** are a way of leading players through the narrative space of a game, highlighting key moments. As a kind of narrative in miniature, cutscenes help fill out the larger narrative frame of the game to establish the fictive world of a game's story.
	* They can allow a player to glimpse another part of the game space.
	* They can work to catapult a player into a new situation (i.e., starting [[Beginning the Story (Tropes)|in media res]])
	* They can establish the mood of the game.
	* They give designers the power to dramatically reveal the outcomes of a player's choices.
	* They allow for [[Writing Story Scenes#Pacing|pacing and rhythm]], slowing down the action or hyping it up.
	* They can be used to illustrate player success or failure.
* *Narrative play can also occur in recounting a game's experience*, creating narratives that exist separately from the actual narrative of the game. This is the phenomenon of **retelling play**.
	* **Replay mode** is one such example, making use of cinematography to cast game events in a particular light.
	* **Recams** - involves altering the perspective after a replay. It allows players to experience the story from a different point of view.
### Play of Simulation
* *Games are [[#Play of Meaning|representation]] systems where representations can arise from the player interacting with the game systems itself*. 
	* This type of representation is called **procedural representation** -- it is the kind of representation that emerges from a process. 
	* *As a simulation, a game is a procedural representation of aspects of "reality". *
	* The objects within a game gain their meanings and representations in part because of how they interact with the formal systems.
	* Unlike other simulations, games are not beholden to a notion of representing empirical truth.
	* Games as simulations also include the ways in which the system permits player action.

* *Every game, on some level represents [[Games as Rules#Systems of Conflict|conflict]]*. Games simulate some form of conflict through its formal systems.
	* **Territorial Conflict** - the play area dynamically represents the territory over which battle is waged.
	* **Economic Conflict** - what is contested is not territory but a unit of value (money, points, etc). This is rooted in the fact that the thing of value is finite.
	* **Conflict over Knowledge** - inherently cultural conflicts that engage with the cultural space outside of the game. They rely on information brought into the game from external sources.

* *Simulation necessitates some form of simplification or stylization*. It is a process of abstracting away properties from a real world phenomenon.
	* *Simulations are abstractions*. We can only approximate reality with simulations, nor do simulations attempt to do such a thing.
	* *Simulations are systems* - the systemic aspect is harnessed directly for representational effect.
	* *Simulations are numerical* - they are formal structures related to some mathematical structure.
	* *Simulations are limited* - they can only depict a tiny slice of any real world or imagined phenomenon. 

* As designers, we choose which aspects to simulate -- ultimately the goal is to simulate what would contribute to meaningful play. 
	* *Promise the right amount of breadth* - if players expect the game to be an immersive simulation, they may be disappointed if their options are limited.
	* [[Creativity#Principles|Limitation is not a bad thing]].
	* *It is generally bad design to include information that does not contribute to an understanding of what is going on*> 

* [[#Narrative Play]] can also be framed as a form of simulation -- players simulate the lived experiences of the player character. In turn, the simulation of the player character brings it to life as a representation of a character.
	* *A player relates to a game character through the double consciousness of play*
		* The protagonist is a persona through which the player exerts themselves on the imaginary world. 
		* At the same time, the character is a puppet, and the player is fully aware they are artificial.
		* The player consciousness has three levels -- *a character in a simulated world, a player in a game, a person in a larger social setting*.

* **Case-based logic** implies creating simulations where the relationship between each element is specified in advanced. **Generalized Logic** replies on system elements sharing common attributes and relying on emergence.
* *A case for generalized simulation*:
	* It decreases work time because we do not need to specify all forms of interactions.
	* It leads to more emergent games.
	* It increases play options. More choices.
* *However, no game can rely solely on generalized simulation*. Designers need to be able to craft some forms of interactions.
	* The generalized approach may end up being too overcomplicated.
	* It may introduce ambiguities.

* **The Immersive Fallacy** -- the idea that pleasure of a media experience lies in its ability to sensually transport the participant into an illusory, simulated reality [^2].
	* The cognitive frame falls away, and the player truly believes they are a part of an imaginary world.
	* *Remember*: A game player can become engrossed in the game, but only through play itself.
	* *Immersion is not just tied to the attributes of a game, but the way it functions with respect to the experience of the player* 
	* Focus on the double consciousness of play rather than immersion.

[^2]: We can argue through Bolter and Grusin's theory that all media operates this way -- through **immediacy** which promises true and authentic representation and **hypermediacy** which emphasizes the constructed nature of media representation. **Remediation** mediates both of these. 

### Social Play
* *As players mingle with each other, their social interactions highlight aspects of the game's design. Meaningful play can be framed as a social phenomenon.*
	* Social interactions can either take place within the magic circle or outside of it. 
	* Social interactions can be modified by actions taken in the game. Social roles transform as the game proceeds.
	* Games can facilitate symbolic communication.

* [[Players and Why We Play Games#Sutton-Smith's Typology|Sutton-Smith's]] and [[Players and Why We Play Games#Bartle's Player Typology|Bartle's]] typologies pply

* A **play community** occurs when a group of player gets together to play a game. The exact scale of the community depends on the game design problem you are trying to solve.
	* Most play communities are informal, temporary affairs.
	* The social boundaries of a play community are tied to the boundaries of its games.
	* The play community emerges from the game system. At the same time, the game cannot have life without a play community. *This happens because games as play systems are both closed and open systems*. 
* Within the bounded play community of a game, the community arises with the onset of the game and disappears when the game is finished.
	* *There is a sense in which games create their own private social sphere*.
	* *Bounded play implies a social contract* consisting of the rules, and the meanings and values the players give life through play. The social contract dictates what it means to enter the magic circle.
	* Generally *players must feel a sense of safety and trust to be comfortable to enter into the social space of a game*. Such safety and trust relies on knowledge of the rules -- especially the implicit rules.
		* Once the rules are known, a free decision can be reached through respectful mutual consent.

* In **transformative social play**, players use the game context to transform social relationships.
	* It forces us to reevaluate a formal understanding of rules as fixed, unambiguous and omnipotent authorities. The structures are reshaped by player action.
	* The formal rules the game operates in may be different from the actual rules that players agree on. *Players can generate their own rules and propagate them in the player community*
	* The real rules of the game refer to a standard of social behavior that players had to accept and uphold if they were to remain a part of the game.
	* In this sense, *the goal is not just to win, but to play the game in a way that embodies the proper spirit of play*, to play the game in a way that expresses their social being. In this sense, *players game the game itself* -- manipulating the boundaries established by the game.
* Games can permit or encourage normally taboo behavior via **forbidden play** -- *games can subvert social norms since games can play with meaning itself*.
	* The player is always at risk of overstepping boundaries and breaking the magic circle.
	* However, even though the behavior is normally taboo, it exists within a restricted context.

* **Metagaming** - refers to the relationship between the game and outside elements. According to Richard Garfield, it manifests as follows:
	* What a player brings **to** a game
		* Game resources - the necessary components for playing the game
		* Strategic Preparation or training
		* Peripheral Game Resources - optional elements like game guides.
		* Player Reputation
	* What a player takes away **from** a game
		* The stakes of the game.
		* The experience of the game itself
		* The retelling of the game
		* Some resources for future games.
	* What happens **between** games
		* Reflection of players regarding strategy, training or planning.
		* Player communicating to each other about what happened last game
		* Anything that add to the meaning of the play experience.
	* What happens **during** a game other than the game itself.
		* Any aspect of real life that influences a game in play -- competition and camaraderie for example.
		* The physical environment of the play itself.

* The emergence of a rich metagame comes from key game design decisions
	* For example by *making many variants on a set of standard rules*
	* However, at the same time, most metagaming comes from when play communicates with the outside context.
