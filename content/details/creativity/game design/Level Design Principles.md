* **Ideate-Design-Playtest-Iterate**. Map design is an iterative process. The important thing is that it is designed with players in mind.
	* Take inspiration from existing maps or from a particular experience you want to capture.
	* Make your maps fun to play so that they are fun to design and fun to playtest. Make map elements serve a fun purpose.
	* Maps are fun to play if they afford different opportunities for play and counterplay for the players,
	* Only by trying new things can you see how bad previous designs were. 
* [Level Design is about integrating the gameplay, the presentation, the story, and the emergent relations between them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NO1lvc3ikXE) 
	* Presentation and Gameplay give rise to affordances and intentionality--how does the level convey what the player can do? How does it convey information and motivation to the player for them to make informed plans and decisions.
	* Presentation and Story give rise to Worldbuilding. How does the level contribute to establishing a unique, cohesive, and meaningful world? Is the worldbuilding ubiquitous in the level? Does it define the characters of the game? 
	* Gameplay and Story give rise to Interactive Narrative. Does the level tell the narrative through the strengths of the gaming medium? Does the level allow thee players to engage with and interact with the story? 

* Levels should [[Narrative|tell a story]]. They should convey something that is mechanically or narratively interesting about the game's world or rules.
