* A good design starts with a great **silhouette**. This makes the art more recognizable.
* A general principle: Break down the desired object into simpler shapes -- cones, spheres, and cubes.
* *To achieve smooth curves:* 
	* Vary the lengths of the segments in a continuous manner.
	* No right angles.
* One technique to make a smooth curve is not necessarily to follow a strict 1-2-3 progression. Rather, we can do 1-2-1-2-1-3  instead.  That is, simulate the smoothness by "staggering" the rows of pixels. 
# Shading and Coloring
* Consider *shading techniques*
	* **Flat Shading** - involves stacking colors. Fewer colors = crisper object. We can texture this by varying the shadow's edges.
	* **Dithering** - involves creating a gradient (i.e., for diffused lighting or see through-effects). We then apply a repeating pattern on the boundary between colors.
* Consider *outlines*: 
	* *Softer outlines = object looks out of focus*.
	* Having a border makes the object pop.
	* Imperfect outlines look more natural. Achieve this by *selective coloring for different parts*.
		* Note: Maintain contrast between the base color and the outline to make it pop out of the background.
* *Pixel art can be thought of as sculpting with color* - we assemble the forms through blobs of color.
* [[Color Theory]] would be really helpful to apply. 
* *No lone pixels*. Colors should occur in clusters (or in dithering).
