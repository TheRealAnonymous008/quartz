* **Hue** - the name of the color family (i.e., Red, Green, Blue, Cyan, Yellow, or Magenta)
* **Saturation** - pertains to how intense or dull the color is. 
	* **Shade** is a related quality. It is the color obtained when black is added to the color .
	* **Tint** is another related quality. It is the color obtained when white is added to the color.
* **Value** - pertains to how light or dark the color is  

* Another way to desaturate is to mix in the complementary color. 

## Palette / Schemes 
* **Analogous** - directly next to each other in the color wheel. The colors farther away from the primary color have increased saturation. 
	* Typically creates a softer design with less contrast. 
* **Monochromatic** - one hue with varying values (going light to dark). 
* **Complementary** - use two colors that are directly adjacent from each other on the color wheel. 
	* The traditional approach is one color is dark and desaturated, the other is light and saturated.
	* It tends to evoke high contrast.
* **Split Complementary** - create a Y on the color wheel.  That is, one dominant color and the two colors adjacent to the dominant color's complement. 
	* All colors provide contrast. Two colors work great together but more than two will require more balance.
* **Triadic** - choose three colors that are equally placed in lines around the color wheel. 
	* Tends to create high contrast while retaining saturation. 
	* Gives a bright and lively appearance. 
* **Square** - choose four equidistant colors from each other. Typically, we choose one dominant color than try to balance all four.

## Color Moods 
* Low value  = Low Contrast and Sharper. High Value = Harsher
* Low saturation = Low energy. High saturation = High energy. 
* Closer to Red = Warmer. Closer to Blue = Colder 
* The key is to balance low and high value. Low and High Saturation.  

* *All mood relies on context*. 
* Start with grayscale to analyze the role of contrast in the image.
