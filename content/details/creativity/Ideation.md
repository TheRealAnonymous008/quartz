* A general guideline from [[The Design of Everyday Things by Norman|DOET:]] Generate potential solutions. Following three rules:
	* **Generate Numerous Ideas**. Do not fixate on one idea.
	* **Be Creative without regard for constraints**.  Even crazy ideas can give creative insights. Do not prematurely dismiss ideas.
	* **Question Everything**. Ask stupid questions that question the assumptions of what is obvious.

* It is hard, yet beneficial to monitor our thinking process.
* Problem solving is habitual. It is determined by both genetics and life experiences. Habits let us solve intellectual problems more rapidly.
* However, habit can inconsistent with [[Creativity]] because creativity demands deviation from past procedure.
* *Often, the first solution is what [[Availability Heuristic|one thinks of and implements]]* even if the first solution is not necessarily the best.
	* Hastily thought-out solutions often create more problems.
