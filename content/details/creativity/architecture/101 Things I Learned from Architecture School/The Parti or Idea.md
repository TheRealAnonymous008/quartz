# The Idea
14. *Architecture begins with an idea*. Good design is driven by an idea rooted in an envisioned experience.
15. A **parti** is the central idea or concept of a building. The design struggle is to create a parti appropriate for the project.
16. Partis derive from non-architectural understandings. *They are influenced by the portrayed narrative, and sociocultural context*.
17. Be specific with the design idea. *Designs that appeal to everyone appeal to no one*. Designing in idea-specific ways gives license for people to bring their own interpretations.
18. The more justifications for a design decision, the better. *Elements should be multipurpose*.
19. Use the parti as a guide to designing the many aspects of a building. Use it to *reinforce the idea of the building*
30. Buildings emerge naturally as a consequence of logic and aesthetics.
31. When having difficulty resolving a design decision, consider it as a 2D or 3D composition. This encourages you to *give balanced attention to form and space*. 
46. *Informed simplicity entails architectural richness*. Unnecessary complexity makes things cluttered.
100. *Give your ideas a name*. A name is a shorthand for the idea that can be used to explain it.
# Sharing the Idea
48. If you can't explain your ideas in simple terms, you don't know your idea well enough. 
57. *Present ideas from general to specific*. A sample flow:
	* State the problem
	* Discuss the contribution.
	* Discuss the design process and major discoveries
	* State the parti
	* Present the plans 
	* Give a self-critique.
67. A good graphic presentation should have labels and titles be legible from ten feet away (the **Ten-Foot-Test**)
93. Designs can be regulated by governments: 
	* **Zoning codes** concern how a building relates to its surroundings.
	* **Building codes** concern with how a building functions.
	* **Accessibility codes** provide for the use of buildings by persons with physical challenges.
