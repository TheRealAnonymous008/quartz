65. Always show structural columns in the floor plan. *Structural considerations encourages thinking of the plans as something for a real building*.
68. *Design in section*. Work back and forth between plans (horizontal cross sections) and sections (vertical cross sections), allowing each to inform the other.
69. A floor plan demonstrates the organizational logic. A section embodies its emotional experience.
70. *Design in perspective*. This allows the architect to consider the visual experience from all perspectives.
72. *Design with Models*. This allows for fast [[details/creativity/design/DOET/Design Thinking|prototyping]].
73. The two most important keys to effectively organizing a floor plan are:
	* Managing solid-void relationships. **Core spaces** (solid) that serve a maintenance role are grouped together. **Program spaces** (void) that serve a building-specific role are larger.
	* Resolving **circulation**. They should interconnect the program spaces with stairs and elevators while offering interesting experiences.
74. Consider served and servant spaces. 
	* **Servant spaces** meet the functional needs of the building while lending quietly poetic rhythms to the whole.
	* **Served spaces** are spaces that are actively used.
76. **Overdesign**. Make spaces 10% larger than they need to be to account for additional design requirements. *It is easier to shrink an overlarge building than to create more space*.
79. Place fire stairs at opposite ends of the buildings you design. *Account for safety early on*.
91. *Buildings should face the street*. This makes buildings more accessible and defines the street more.
