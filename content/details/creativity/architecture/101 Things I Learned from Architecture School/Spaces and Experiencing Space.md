# Spaces
2. A **figure** is an element on the page. The **Ground** is the space of the page.
3. **Figure-Ground Theory** states that the space that results from placing figures should be considered as carefully as the figures themselves. 
	* People perceive things as part of **negative space** if it is unshaped.
	* **Positive space** is space that has an apparent shape and boundary.
4. **Implied elements** are those that can be seen even if they are not on drawn.
5. **Solid-Void Theory** holds that volumetric spaces shaped or implied by the placement of solid objects are as, if not more, important than the objects themselves.
	* **Positive space** pertains to a well-defined, bounded region with a notion of in and out.
	* **Negative space** pertains to an unbounded region or one with no inside and outside.
6. We move through negative spaces and dwell in positive spaces. *Space influences human behavior*
7. *Building shape and layout affect space*
	* Suburban buildings are freestanding objects in space, creating large negative space. 
	* Urban buildings are often shapers of space, creating small positive space.
