37. Any aesthetic quality is usually enhanced by the presence of a **counterpoint**. This is playing with the viewer's expectations.
38. *Use prior symbolisms*. For example, the cardinal points offer associations [^38]
	* East - youthfulness, innocence, freshness.
	* South - activity, clarity, simplicity,
	* West - aging, questioning, wisdom
	* North - maturity, acceptance, death.
39. A **static composition**, usually symmetrical, appears to be at rest. It suggests power, firmness and permanence, but also prone to looking boring or unengaging
40. A **dynamic composition**, usually asymmetrical, encourages the eye to explore. It suggests fun, movement, aggression, and excitement, but also prone to looking jarring or disorienting.
41. To create a dynamic, yet, balanced composition, make a strong design decision that is unbalanced, and *use counterpoints to balance the strong dynamic design*. Counterpoints are an aesthetic rebuttal.
44. Use **color theory**. Colors can be associated with seasons, or temperature. 
	* *Cool colors* tend to recede from the viewer.
	* *Warm colors* appear closer to the viewer.
	* Use *complements* to add balance.
51. *It is the dialogue and unity among the pieces, not the pieces themselves, that creates aesthetic success*. Aesthetics imply harmonious design
52. *Asymmetrical balance demonstrates sophisticated thinking*. It is difficult to nail asymmetrical balance.
56. Most architectural forms can be classified as follows:
	* **Additive** forms appear to have been assembled from individual pieces.
	* **Subtractive** forms appear to have been carved from a whole form.
	* **Shaped** forms appear to have been formed from a plastic material through applied force.
	* **Abstract** forms are of uncertain origin.
64. If you rotate or skew an aspect of a building, make it mean something.
88. An object will feel more balanced or whole when its secondary articulation runs counter to its primary geometry (i.e., striating a rectangle parallel to the short side).
