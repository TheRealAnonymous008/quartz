* The patterns derive from our [[The Psychology of Everyday Actions|Conceptual Models]]. A **pattern** *is a rule that describes what to do to generate the entity which it defines*.
* Each pattern is a **morphological law** which establishes a set of relationships in space. It can be expressed as 
  
  $$
  X \to r(A, B,\dots)
  $$
  Read as "within context of types $X$, the parts $A,B, \dots$, are [[Relation|related]] by relationship $r$.
	* Each law or pattern is itself a pattern of relationships with other laws. 

* The [[Syntax]] of the [[The Language of Patterns|pattern language]] lets us rule out meaningless patterns. *The pattern language gives us precision*
	* A pattern language is a collection of patterns which *correspond to profound observations* about what makes something beautiful.
	* The most mystical and wonderful are not less ordinary than most things -- they are more ordinary than most thing, and because of that they strike to the core.
	* Depth is not achieved by the fact a rule can be expressed, but rather by the fact the rule is extremely [[Archetypes|deep]].
	* *It takes great powers of observation to formulate the rules in this language*.
* *Each pattern is a three-part rule* which expresses a relation between a context, a problem and a solution. 
* Patterns exist within contexts -- they are required to address certain needs. As such, patterns form a [[Linguistics|language]]. In it -- [^pattern_langauge]
	* The elements are patterns
	* Each pattern has some [[Characterizing Systems|structure]] that describes it as a pattern of smaller patterns -- how they are created with respect to patterns.
	* Each pattern is also a rule. 
	* The patterns are generative in nature -- it tells us how to construct arrangements which satisfy the rules .
	* Patterns exist in various scales.

* The inner structure of the pattern can be understood by asking
	* "*What*" precisely is present in the pattern. What is the context .
	* "*Why*" does the pattern exist. What problem does it solve. What system of forces are involved in the pattern 
	* "*When / Where*" will this pattern work.  We must define the exact range of contexts where the problem occurs and where the solution is appropriate.
* *Because it is contextual, every pattern is self-contained*.  To say a pattern is alive is to say that there is an empirical relationship between a limited context, a set of forces and a pattern which resolves these forces. 
* *Discovering patterns begins with observation*
	* Begin with a set of structures and study what common features they have (a hypothesized pattern)
	* Identify the problem that exists in those structures which lack the pattern -- typically this requires us to identify the forces at work and how the pattern resolves these forces.
	* *Knowledge of the invariants* that come from domain knowledge then helps solve the problem. *Patterns help us discover invariants*.
	* Update our [[Bayesian Models|beliefs]] about the pattern by observing the structures again with the invariants in mind. In particular, *we test if the pattern is good* -- if it satisfies these two criteria
		* *The problem is real* - The problem does occur within the context.
		* *The configuration / pattern solves the problem* - The pattern can resolve the problem without any side effects.

* One challenge is that -- *it is hard to be precise when it comes to patterns* because there could be more than one formulation to the pattern. It helps, therefore, to *think of patterns as fluid templates that capture some invariant in relation to some problem within some context*.
* And once we have discovered the pattern, *we must then identify how to reify it in the real world*. 
	* We must be able to [[details/creativity/architecture/101 Things I Learned from Architecture School/Drawing|sketch]] it 
	* We must [[Faculties of the Mind|Name it]] so that we can talk about it further.
* *Patterns are never final*. They are subject to change given new evidence. 

* *Caveat*: Even if a pattern seems sensible and has clear reasoning behind it, does not mean that the pattern is capable of generating life.
	* A pattern only works when it deals with all the forces present in the situation. However, in practice, it is difficult to know exactly what the forces in a situation are.
	* To assess whether a pattern can generate life requires relying on "feel" than intellect.
		* *Patterns made from thoughts without feeling lack empirical reality entirely*
		* Using "feelings" means that we are able to look at the totality of the system, and in this sense, it gives us a way to test the pattern -- *A pattern is likely good if and only if it makes us feel good*
		* This "[[Faculties of the Mind|feeling]]" is not tied to opinion, taste or notions. 
			* *It is hard to give up preconceptions of what things ought to be and recognize things as they are*
			* Preconceptions and Opinions on what ought to be blind us from what is "real". It stunts creativity
			* *A pattern which is real makes no value judgments about the legitimacy of the forces in the situation*. In this sense of unethical-ness, the pattern allows things to be alive. 
		* In this context, feelings tie to a sense of empathy. 
		* It is painstaking because it demands paying attention to these feelings
		* From an empirical perspective, this ties to using qualitative methods on top of quantitative methods.
		* *At its core, this method relies on testing for the presence of [[The Nameless Quality]]. We feel the system-ness of the system.*
