* Patterns are inherently [[Memetics|memetic]] in nature. They thrive within culture in the same way that memes do, and they encapsulate a certain worldview

# [[Patterns in Time and Space]]
# Pattern Languages
* *Pattern Languages are the [[Genetics|Genetic code]] to the things we build*.  All acts of building have an underlying pattern language -- a byproduct of the languages which people use.
	* *Language is our way of ascribing patterns in the world.*
	* Each pattern encapsulate some rule of thumb followed by people.
	* Every person has a unique pattern language in his mind based on their own experiences.
* The things we build are unique yet suited for a particular function. This is possible because we copy patterns where they are useful.

* The pattern language is constructed using the network of connections among individual patterns. 
	* *This language emerges as a consequence of the composability of patterns and how interconnected these patterns are.* Patterns influence other patterns. 
	* As with regular languages, we can think of other patterns within the language as words which *provide additional context to each other*
	* We say that the pattern language is good when it is
		* **Morphologically complete** -- the patterns together form a complete structure. It is easy to reify the abstract structure encoded by the patterns into something concrete
		* **Functionally complete** - the [[System Science|system]] of patterns is self-sufficient 
	* *A pattern language is complete if every pattern in the language is complete*. The pattern is complete when we can identify all of its principal components

* The [[Syntax]] of the [[The Language of Patterns|pattern language]] lets us rule out meaningless patterns. *The pattern language gives us precision*
	* A pattern language is a collection of patterns which *correspond to profound observations* about what makes something beautiful.
	* The most mystical and wonderful are not less ordinary than most things -- they are more ordinary than most thing, and because of that they strike to the core.
	* Depth is not achieved by the fact a rule can be expressed, but rather by the fact the rule is extremely [[Archetypes|deep]].
	* *It takes great powers of observation to formulate the rules in this language*.
	* The syntax of the pattern language lets us specify an ordering for these patterns such that reading this order lets us gradually design an image of a structure one pattern at a time. *The more this ordering is enforced, the more coherent a person's vision of the final structure becomes*. It requires that
		* If pattern $A$ is above pattern $B$ in the network of the language, take $A$ before $B$. 
		* Take all the patterns immediately above $A$ as close together in sequence. 
		* Take all the patterns immediately below the pattern $A$ as close together in sequence

* *The language created for a structure must be judged as if it were a finished, concrete structure*. Just from the underlying language alone, one should be able to assess the quality of the structure

* Pattern languages, themselves, are composable with each other. 
	* The patterns in these pattern languages tend to overlap. 
	* Different patterns in different languages have underlying similarities, which suggest they can be [[Group Isomorphism|reformulated]] to make them more general in a greater variety of cases .
	* *Languages can be combined to form bigger languages*
	* A common pattern language for an entire community arises due to a shared pool of patterns based on shared experiences. 
	* As patterns evolve, the pool of patterns available within the pattern language also changes.
* *The pattern language is a living picture of a culture and a way of life*. 

## [[Pattern Structure]]

## Patterns and Society
* Everything that has ever been made was made within the framework of a pattern language.
	* *Patterns are not just responsible for the specific shape a building has, but to the extent to which it comes to life.*
	* Patterns are composable in an infinite number of ways
	* *A living pattern language gives rise to creations that are alive*
	* The rules within these pattern languages are simple and easy to convey between speakers of this language.
* Pattern languages that are widely shared thrive. 
* Those that lose its speakers, and those where the people using the creations from a pattern language, themselves, do not speak this language, die. 
	* *When people lose their pattern languages, they lose touch with their most elementary intuitions*. They make decisions which fundamentally do not make sense with respect to nature.
	* As soon as a few people begin to build for the many, their patterns about what is needed becomes abstract -- gradually losing touch with reality.  [^abstraction]
	* This only fuels a [[System Archetypes|negative feedback loop]] where pattern languages become more fragmented.
	* *So long as people are separated from the pattern languages used to create things, these creations cannot be alive*
* To make sure that pattern languages live ultimately requires a [[System Opportunities|paradigm shift]]

* Every act of building brings a handful of patterns into existence
* Every pattern language exists as part of a larger language. *Each pattern in this language helps the other patterns emerge*
	* The pattern language as a whole helps perpetuate the creative process that is constantly in flux. 
## Bringing Patterns To Life
* To work our way toward a shared and living language once again, we must first learn how to discover patterns which are deep and capable of generating life.
* *This requires finding a way to talk about patterns in a way that can be shared*
	* This, first, requires understanding how patterns are structured.
	* Then we make the inner structure of the pattern clear (see [[#Pattern Structure|here]]) 
	* A pattern is shareable only if one knows how to reify it into the real world.
* Gradually, by hard work, it is possible to discover many patterns which are deep and which can help to bring a structure to life. They vary from culture to culture, but it is possible to discover them and to write them down so they can be shared.
* *A language can live only if it is shared and only if it each person can speak a dialect / personal variant of it*
	* To reach this state requires that each person re-create the pattern language in their mind.
	* As each person makes up their own pattern language for themselves, the language becomes a living one. 
	* Each person shapes the language with their own experiences. 
* When people share the pattern language, it will evolve on its own accord. *The language evolves because it can evolve one pattern at a time.*
	* This process is a genetic process -- good patterns are naturally selected for while bad patterns die out.
	* Each pattern evolves on its own accord.

## Timelessness
* *Language lets us be egoless*. 
* We cannot achieve the nameless quality if we slavishly cling onto our patterns.
* *timelessness is not a byproduct of languages. Languages only remind us of its character.* It reminds us of what we well and truly know as true.
* *The language frees us to be ourselves*. It gives us permission to do what is natural.  It brings out our genuine thoughts.
* The language gives us confidence in what seemed once like trivial things. *It teaches us to be receptive of what is real.*
