* A building or town will only be alive to the extent that it is governed by the timeless way. 
	* It is powerful and fundamental -- any building can be made as beautiful as any place with the timeless way. 
	* The timeless way is at the core of any successful project. It has existed throughout history. It is the one, invariant process that allows things to come alive.
	* *Even if it is invariant, it does not mean that it is mechanical. Instead, it helps us realize processes that are intrinsically within every human.*
	* Such a method is [[Complex Systems|emergent]] in nature. It is not bound by any mechanistic rules that we may impose but arises naturally. 
	* The timeless way involves learning the discipline that teaches us our relationship within nature, and then giving it up to act as nature does.

* The timeless way is the process that brings *order out of nothing but ourselves*; it  cannot be attained, but it will happen on its own accord, if we will only let it.

* It involves the following:
	* A way of looking at things (patterns)
	* A way of understanding how these things come about. 

* It is the pattern languages that we find the way to create the structures around us. *It is not expertise that is required, rather a pattern language that is alive and used extensively*
	* Buildings are the result of a myriad of smaller acts.
	* Yet, this process is not chaotic. It hinges on both creation and repair -- both making structures and correcting any mistakes. *The creative process is always in flux*.
	* The self-correcting nature is due to the fact that everything is [[Characterizing Systems|systemic and interconnected]].

# Incorporating The Way in Design
* [[Design]] is often thought of as a process of synthesis where the whole is created by creating together parts. But *it is impossible to form anything natural using preformed parts*.
	* It is impossible for modular parts to create something unique and alive. 
	* Each part must be modified in the process of creating the structure.  *Each part must be modified within the context of the larger whole*
	* A design is generated by a sequence of patterns, and following this sequence always has the end whole in mind. 
* And in laying out the patterns in sequence, we must imagine it as if we were laying out the most wonderful instance of that pattern in the world. *This is how we reify the pattern and concretely bring it to life*.
	* *It is only when one takes the pattern seriously that they can bring it to life*. All it takes is bringing it to mind.
	* The mind is a medium within which the creative spark that jumps between the pattern and the world can happen. *Let the patterns form themselves*
	* Importantly, *we must focus on one pattern at a time*. We cannot fully realize one pattern if we are worried about the next pattern in the sequence. *Indeed, we need not worry about patterns breaking other patterns because we can simply transform these patterns*
	* When one pays attention to each pattern, we can let it have its fully intensity.
