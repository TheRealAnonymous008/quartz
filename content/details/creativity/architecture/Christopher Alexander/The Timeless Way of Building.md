* A building or town will only be alive to the extent that it is governed by the timeless way. 
	* It is powerful and fundamental -- any building can be made as beautiful as any place with the timeless way. 
	* The timeless way is at the core of any successful project. It has existed throughout history. It is the one, invariant process that allows things to come alive.
	* *Even if it is invariant, it does not mean that it is mechanical. Instead, it helps us realize processes that are intrinsically within every human.*
	* Such a method is [[Complex Systems|emergent]] in nature. It is not bound by any mechanistic rules that we may impose but arises naturally. 
	* The timeless way involves learning the discipline that teaches us our relationship within nature, and then giving it up to act as nature does.

* The timeless way is the process that brings *order out of nothing but ourselves*; it  cannot be attained, but it will happen on its own accord, if we will only let it.

* It involves the following:
	* A way of looking at things (patterns)
	* A way of understanding how these things come about.
