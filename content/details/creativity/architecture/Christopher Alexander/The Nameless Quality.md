* To seek the timeless way, we must first know the **quality** without a name. *There is a central quality which is the root criterion of life and spirit. This quality is objective and precise, but cannot be named*.

* There is an objective difference between good and bad architecture. It is easy, however, to say that no such quality exists because such a quality cannot be named.
* The quality is never twice the same because it always takes its shape from the particular place where it occurs.
* *The quality is a kind of freedom from contradictions*. Something has this when it "feels" natural -- when what it ought to be grows naturally from what it is. *This quality is what makes things live.*
* *The quality cannot be named because it is so precise that words fail to do it justice*. Some approximations
	* **Alive** -- the quality where things feel life-like an natural. Yet, this is merely a metaphor 
	* **Whole** -- the quality where things are free from inner contradictions. Yet, this suggests finiteness and self-containment
	* **Comfortable** - the quality of having no inner contradictions and having little restlessness. Yet, comfort is imprecise.
	* **Free** - the quality happens when ideas and images are left behind. Yet, freedom might be too amorphous, contrived, or theatrical.
	* **Exact** - the quality has a sense of balance and precision. Yet, exactness means a lack of freedom and can mean fitting to an abstract idea rather than being adapted exactly to the forces which are in it.
	* **Egoless** - the quality is a byproduct of nature rather than an artificial created. Yet, an egoless nature is not necessary to achieve the quality. Personality can be injected too. 
	* **Eternal** - all things with the quality are eternal. They are stable and self-maintaining. Yet, using eternal as a name for this quality implies that it is mysterious. What makes something eternal is that it is ordinary. 

* The quality is not just simple beauty. Not form fitting function. Not spiritual in nature. *The quality includes these but it is so ordinary that it somehow reminds us of the passing of our life.*

* *The search which we make for this quality in our own lives is the central search of any person* and the crux of any individual person's [[Narrative|story]]. It is the search for those moments and situation when we are most alive.
	* In our lives, this quality without a name is the most precious thing we have.
	* This wild freedom comes into our lives in the instant we [[Stoicism|let go]].  Until one lets go of their fears and preconceptions, it is impossible to be alive.
	* The quality can only be achieved when our inner forces are resolved. When we have nothing to keep and nothing to lose.
	* We cannot be aware of the precious moments where the nameless quality arises, but we know the feeling which the quality creates in us.
	* *Because of this, we can recognize the quality in our work.* We need only ask which has caused us to feel this quality.
	* Places which have this quality invite this quality to come to life in us, and in turn we tend to make it come to life in the things we build. *It is the quality of life and we must seek it simply in order that we can ourselves become alive*
