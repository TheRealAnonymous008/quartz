* To identify this [[The Nameless Quality|quality]] in buildings and towns, we must begin by understanding that *every place is given its character by certain patterns of [[Spaces and Experiencing Space|events]] that keep happening there.*
	* What a town or building is, is governed, above all, by what is happening there. Most especially, by the events which frequently happen there.
	* Our experiences in these spaces depend not just on the environment but the patterns of events we experience there. 
	* The patterns of events are not necessarily human events. They can come from nature too.
	* *Such is true for life as well, the character of a person is defined by the patterns of events that happen in their lives.*
	* The patterns of events are dependent on culture as well.
	* This is illustrative of the fact that  *the world has a structure* every pattern of events is anchored in space. Events must happen somewhere, in fact *events are inseparable from space*
	* The list of elements which are typical in a culture tells us the way of life of the people there.
	* *Spaces do not necessarily bring about events, but cultural ideas and norms about these spaces*.
	* The life which happens in a town is not merely anchored in space, but is made up from the space itself.

* Every town is built out of patterns in space and nothing else. *Patterns are the building blocks of buildings*. 
	* On the geometric level, we see *physical elements repeating endlessly* in an almost endless variety of combinations. However, elements cannot be the building blocks of buildings because the same type of building can have different elements.
	* Beyond its elements, *patterns of [[System Science|relationships]] occur among the elements*. A large part of the structure of a space consists of this pattern of relationships. Indeed, these patterns of relationships are essential to each element.
	* In fact, *the elements themselves are patterns of relationships*. Each element is [[Category Theory|defined based on the pattern of relationships]] it has with its surroundings.
	* *Elements are labels for the patterns of relationships which do repeat.*

* Space is also associated with patterns of events, but *patterns in space and patterns in events do not cause each other. Patterns are a byproduct of [[Games as Culture|culture]]*. 
	* However, patterns in space sustain patterns of events. Events are sustained with appropriate spaces.
	* Each pattern of relationships in space is congruent to some specific pattern of events. It is the precise nature of these patterns which allow the pattern of events to repeat.

* *Most remarkably, each place is only composed of a few patterns*

* The specific patterns out of which a building or town is made may be alive or dead. 
	* To the extent they are alive, they let our inner forces loose and set us free. They let man be their genuine self.
	* When they are dead, they keep us locked in inner conflict. They keep us in a perpetual state of tension.
	* *A person's state of harmony is formed by his surroundings*.
	* Patterns that are alive do not spark conflict within us because of conflicting desires. These patterns, instead, resolve our conflicts for ourselves.
	* It is not enough for a pattern to be utilitarian. *Good patterns are good because to some extent they reach the nameless quality..*
	* *Patterns are alive if they are stable*. They are consistent with how things ought to be and are repeatable.
		* Destructive patterns, while they may be stable in the short-run, destroy their surroundings and themselves -- making them unstable in the long run.
		* *Quality is not dependent on purpose but intrinsic stability* It does not have to be maintained by force.
		* A pattern lives when it allows its own internal forces to resolve themselves
	* The more living patterns there are in a thing, the more it comes to life as an entirety, the more it has the nameless quality.
		* *If a thing has many dead patterns, the imbalance and tension within these dead patterns spread to other patterns* which causes the whole to slowly die.
		* Patterns that are alive are [[Network Robustness|robust]] and [[Complex Systems|interconnected]]. The individual configuration of any pattern requires [[Characterizing Systems#Internal Organization and Structure|other]] patterns to keep itself alive. *The more alive patterns, the more beautiful the building*.
		* The quality without a name appears not when an isolated pattern lives, but when an entire system of patterns is stable and alive.
	* *Patterns that are alive follow the patterns observed in [[The Nameless Quality#The Quality of Nature|nature]]*.
		* It is patterns that repeat not the constituent parts.
		* Patterns repeat at every scale.
		* The apparent imperfections of a place which is alive are not imperfections. They follow from how a part is fitted to a particular position.
