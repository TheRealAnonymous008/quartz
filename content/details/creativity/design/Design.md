* *The real work of any process of design lies in the task of making up the [[The Language of Patterns|language]]* from which you can generate the one particular design. The language gives the structure and content to the design and is (ideally) generalizable to similar contexts and problems.
* The process of design is a process of complexification. Gradually, iteratively, new structure is laid out and emerges
* Design is a wicked problem -- it can only be clearly defined only by solving it 
* Design is sloppy because a good solution is often only subtly different from a poor one. Even the definition of "good" is hard t define.
* Design is about tradeoffs, priorities, and restrictions. 
* The design space is so big and multiple designs may be valid. Design decisions are thus often [[Metaheuristics|heuristics]]. 

* *One of the most effective guidelines is to not get stuck on a single approach.* 
	* The more dogmatic you are about applying a design method, the fewer real-life problems you are going to solve
* You donâ€™t have to solve the whole design problem at once. Don't be afraid to put off resolving issues when you don't have enough information. 

* Often there are two approaches to design
	* **Top Down** starts with a high level of abstraction and slowly increases the level of detail.
		* Continue decomposing until it seems as if it would be easier to do the next step than to decompose it. *Work until you become somewhat impatient at how obvious and easy the design seems.*
		* It is easier to use than bottom up but low-level complexity might ripple back to the top.
	* **Bottom Up** starts with specifics and works towards generalities in an inductive manner.
		* Start with what you know the object needs to do and then *compose parts to form the whole based on what you know the object needs to be*
		* It is harder to use because it starts complex, but identifies the complexities of the design early on.
	* *Both approaches are valid and synergize with each other*
