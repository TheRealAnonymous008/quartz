20. *Good designers are fast on their feet*. A poor  designer holds on to a failing parti. A good designer sees the erosion of the parti as an indicator of where the project should go next.
28. *Good designers aren't afraid of throwing away good ideas*. Not every good idea belongs to the current project.
29. *Be process-oriented, not product driven*. This is a difficult, but important skill
	* Seek to understand a design problem before solving it.
	* Do not force-fit solutions to old problems to new ones.
	* Do not be attached to ideas. Be slow to fall in love with ideas.
	* Be holistic in design decisions.
	* Make design decisions with the awareness they may not work out.
	* Know when to change and when to stick with previous decisions.
	* Accept as normal the anxiety that comes from not knowing what to do.
	* Work fluidly between coarse and fine grain.
	* Always ask what-ifs now matter how good the solution is.
31. Strive for *improving your design process* more than improving your creative outputs.
32. *Engage with meta-thinking*. Be mindful of your thought processes. Have an internal dialogue and critique yourself.
45. The **three levels of knowing**
	* **Simplicity** is engaging fully with the experience but only at a surface level.
	* **Complexity** is viewing the underlying complex systems but being unable to appreciate the patterns and connections.
	* **Informed Simplicity** entails pattern recognition.
61. *Less is More*. Don't clutter design.
62. *Less is a bore*. Don't make the piece boring
77. *No design system is or should be perfect*. Oddities add enriching aspects. Break the rules as needed.
78. *Success is not defined by how flawless a piece is, but by the depth embodied within the work*.
81. Properly gaining control of the design process tends to feel like losing control of the design process. *Design does not have predetermined outcomes*.
86. *Manage your ego*. Forget about what you want the building to be, ask what the building wants to be. 
92. *Design with the larger context in mind*.
97. *Limitations encourage creativity*. 
98. *Crisis = Danger + Opportunity*. A design problem is not a problem but an opportunity. The best solutions do not make the problem go away, but accept the problem as a natural state of the world.
99. The best way to get started is to *just do something*. Even the act of scribbling lets you learn more about the problem.
