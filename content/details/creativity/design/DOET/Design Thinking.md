* *The secret to success is to understand what the real problem is*. It is easy to see only the surface problems and never dig deeper to address the real issues.
* *Design is not marketing*. Design concerns what people need and use. Marketing concerns what people will buy.
	* Design is usually qualitative. Marketing is quantitative.
	* Note that *numerical correlations say nothing of people's needs*.
	* See also [[Trade Offs#Forest for the Trees Trade-Off|the trade-offs page]]. Both are needed. Design specifications need to include buying and using a product.
# Design Pipeline
* *Design is an iterative and expansive process*. Start from first principles--the real problem that needs solving.
* **Human Centered Design** is the process of ensuring that people's needs are met, that the resulting product is understandable, usable, and pleasing to use. It emphasizes 
	* Solving the right problem and 
	* Finding the right solution accounting for human needs and capabilities.
* The **Double Diamond** design process is based on what HCD emphasizes.
	* It has four stages: **Discover, Define, Develop, Deliver**
	* In the process of the double diamond, encourage free exploration (divergence) but put constraints via a deadline and budget to encourage convergence.

### Human Centered Design
* HCD has four activities (repeated in a cycle)
* **Observation** 
	* Understand the nature of the problem itself and the users affected.
	* Use **Applied Ethnography**. Observe target users in their natural environment, wherever the product or service being designed will actually be used.
	* The goal is to *determine human needs that can be addressed with new products*. 
* **Ideation**
	* Generate potential solutions. Following three rules:
		* **Generate Numerous Ideas**. Do not fixate on one idea.
		* **Be Creative without regard for constraints**.  Even crazy ideas can give creative insights. Do not prematurely dismiss ideas.
		* **Question Everything**. Ask stupid questions that question the assumptions of what is obvious.
* **Prototyping**
	* Quickly build a prototype or mock up solution for testing.
	* Settle for low fidelity prompts so that we don't have to commit too much to producing them.
	* The **Wizard of Oz Technique**, mimic a complex system's functionalities through smoke and mirrors instead of actually making the system.
	* *Prototype to ensure the problem is well understood*. 
* **Testing**
	* Using a small group of people representative of the target demographic, test the prototype.
	* While the test is happening, observe how users are operating the prototype.
	* When the test is over, understand the subject's thought processes.
* **Iteration** 
	* It enables continual refinement. *Fail Frequently, Fail Fast*
	* Failures in testing are learning experiences.
	* *Requirements are developed by watching people in their natural environment*. 
	* With each iteration, the ideas become clearer as specifications become better defined, and prototypes better approximate the target.
	* The process ends depending on external bureaucratic constraints (schedules and budget).
	* Note that *iterative design has its drawbacks when compared to linear design*.
		* If too much time is wasted on iterating, no product will be produced.
		* Additionally, iteration incurs a cost in time and money.
		* Iteration is best suited for specifications, and early design phases since it is not scalable.
		* Linear design gives management better control, even if cumbersome.
		* *Combine the two methods*. Delay specifications until iterative testing is done, but also keep a tight control of schedule.

### Activity Centered Design
* HCD focuses on people. For products with near universal coverage, focus on **activity centered design**. *Design for activities, and the result will be usable by everyone*. 

* **Activities** are collections of tasks performed towards a high level goal. A **task** is a cohesive set of operations directed towards a low-level goal.
* There are three kinds of goals
	* **Be-goals** govern a person's being, determine why they act, and are fundamental. 
	* **Do goals** determine plans and actions for an activity.
	* **Motor goals** specify how actions are performed.

* In ACD, The activity defines the product and its structure.
* The conceptual model of the product is congruent to the conceptual model of the activity.
* This works since *people's activities across the world tend to be similar*.
* *Support the activities while being sensitive to human capabilities and people will accept the design and learn whatever is necessary*.
# Challenges in Design
### Design Pipeline in Practice
* In practice, none of the above methods are followed perfectly due to business and engineering pressures.
* **Don Norman's Law of Product Development** - *The day a product development process starts, it is behind schedule and above budget*.
	* See [[Egocentric Biases|the planning fallacy]] for something related to this.
* A proposed solution to this dissonance is to *separate the design research from the product team*, so that design researchers are always out on the field.
* Additionally, *design teams should be multidisciplinary* so that all participants understand the role of each discipline.
* Design should be *flexible*, accommodating a wide range of people.
### The Design Challenge
* *The fundamental principles of designing for people are the same across all domains*.
* Design addresses constraints:
	* Products have *multiple conflicting requirements*.
	* The people buying the product are not always those who use it.
	* In some situation *cost* dominates.
	* It is also important to consider the people who will make the design a reality.
	* Designs *have to accommodate for special people and special cases*. Sometimes it is impossible to build a product that accommodates everyone, so different versions are needed.
	* Many products carry a *stigma* about people's difficulties.
### Standardization
* It is easy for smaller companies to standardize niche products. It is harder to standardize more universally used products.
* *Politics and [[Economics]] affect standardization processes* .
* Sometimes standard take so long to be established that by the time they do come into wide practice, they can be irrelevant.
### Intentionally Bad Design
* Some things ought to be deliberately difficult to for safety, privacy, or security reasons.
* *Even with intentionally bad design, the rules of good design because*.
	* Even deliberately difficult designs aren't entirely difficult. Only one part is difficult.
	* Knowledge on good design lends to knowledge on  how to go about making bad designs.
