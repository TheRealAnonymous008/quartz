* The **legacy problem** - *too many devices use the existing standard, even when it may be poorly designed*. Standardization is almost impossible due to the wide use of the legacy, which makes changes expensive.
	* Lack of attention to customer needs on even simple things is often symptomatic of larger issues that have greater impact.
# Constraints
* The thoughtful use of **constraints** in design lets people readily determine the proper course of action, even in a novel situation.
### Kinds of Constraints
* **Physical Constraints**
	* Physical limitations constrain possible operations. They rely upon properties of the physical world or their operation.
	* They are more effective if they are easy to see and interpret.
	* **Forcing functions** are a physical constraint--situations in which the actions are constrained so that failure at one stage prevents the next step from happening.
		* Forcing functions are the extreme case of strong constraints that can prevent inappropriate behavior
		* **Interlocks** forces operations to take place in proper sequence. In most cases it is to prevent something dangerous (an example is a dead man's switch).
		* **Lock-Ins** keep an operation active, preventing someone from prematurely stopping it (i.e., alerts that prevent exiting an unsaved document).
		* **Lockouts** prevents someone from entering a dangerous space or occurring. It prevents an action until the desired operations have been done.
		* Forcing functions *can be a nuisance in normal storage*, leading to people deliberately disabling them.
			* A clever designer minimizes the nuisance value of the forcing function without sacrificing safety.
* **Cultural Constraints**
	* Each culture has a set of allowable actions for social situations.
	* *Cultural issues are at the root of many of the problems we have with new machines*: there are as yet no universally accepted conventions or customs for dealing with them.
	* Cultural constraints are likely to change with time.
	* **Conventions** are a cultural constraint associated with how people behave. They provide those knowledgeable of the culture with powerful constraints on behavior.
		* Conventions can be codified into standards (formal or informally agreed upon), laws or both.
		* Signals are useful for communicating between people, but only if both people follow the same conventions.
		* People who violate conventions are marked outsiders.
		* *Unknown norms lead to discomfort and confusion*.
* **Semantic Constraints**
	* Constraints that rely upon the meaning of the situation to control the set of possible actions.
	* They rely upon our knowledge of the situation and the world.
	* Semantic constraints can change with time. Meanings of today may not be the meanings of the future.
* **Logical Constraints**
	* Constraints that rely on logic (i.e., there is only one place where X could go).
	* Natural mappings can help establish logical constraints (i.e., between spatial layout of the controls and the devices).
# Discoverability and Conventions
* Visible affordances and signifiers (see [[The Psychopathology of Everyday Things|here]]) can act as physical constraints.
* In many cases, an understanding of potential actions derived from perceived affordances come from **conventions**. *The interpretation of a perceived affordance is a cultural convention.*
* On the whole, *consistency is to be followed Consistency allows us to transfer from one system to another*. 
	* People invariably object and complain whenever a new approach is introduced into an existing array of products and systems
	* If a new way of doing things is only slightly better than the old, it is better to be consistent.
	* If there is a change, everybody has to change
	* When a new way of doing things is vastly superior to another, then the merits of change outweigh the difficulty of change.
	* *Natural mappings derive from cultural conventions or constraints*.
* The **principle of desperation: If all else fails, standardize**
	* When no other solution appears possible, simply design everything the same way.
	* This introduces a new cultural constraint that makes it easier to remember what to do even if knowledge is in the world.
	* Ideally, standards should reflect conceptual models not physical mechanics.
* When visual signifiers and feedback are not enough, *use sound to convey information about its source*.
	* Sounds can be annoying. Hence they should convey an action that is immediately taking place but is otherwise not visible.
	* One of the virtues of sounds is that they can be detected even when attention is applied elsewhere. But this virtue is also a deficit, for sounds are often intrusive and difficult to keep private.
	* The absence of sound can mean an absence of knowledge, and *if feedback from an action is expected to come from sound, silence can lead to problems*
	* **Skeumorphism** - the technical term for incorporating old, familiar ideas into new technologies, even though they no longer play a functional role. *This eases the [[The 48 Laws of Power#38. Think As You Like But Behave Like Others|transition from old to new]]*.
