* Two of the most important characteristics of good design are discoverability and understanding. 
	* **Discoverability**: Is it possible to even figure out what actions are possible and where and how to perform them? It involves five concepts:
		* **Affordances** - a relationship between the properties of an object and the capabilities of the agent that determines how the object could be used. *Good affordances are discoverable and determine what is possible*.
		* **Signifiers** - a property of an object that signals appropriate behavior to a person (i.e., where to perform an action on the object). *Good signifiers are perceivable and not misleading*.
			* Perceived affordances often act as signifiers but they are ambiguous. 
			* Signifiers tend to be more important than affordances since they communicate how to use the design.
		* **Mapping** - the relationship between the elements of two sets of things. *Mappings determine how we should layout certain things*
			* The relationship between a control and its results is easiest to learn whenever there is an understandable mapping between the controls, the actions, and the intended result.
			* *Natural mappings lead to immediate understandings*. These mappings take advantage of intuitive knowledge (spatial positioning or cultural knowledge).
		* **Feedback** - communicates the results of an action. 
			* *Good feedback is immediate and informative*. 
			* Feedback is essential, but not when it gets in the way of other things, including a calm and relaxing environment.
			* Present unimportant information in an unobtrusive fashion, and important signals in a way that captures attention.
		* **Conceptual Model** - a, usually highly simplified, explanation of how something works. 
			* *It doesn't have to be complete or accurate as long as it is useful*
			* Simplified models are valuable as long as the assumptions that support them hold true.
			* Products often have multiple conceptual models for different people.
			* *The major clues to how things work come from their perceived structure*. Conceptual models derive from the device itself.
			* Conceptual models are valuable in providing understanding, in predicting how things will behave, and in figuring out what to do when things do not go as planned.
			* *Good communication is key to good conceptual models which are key to enjoyable products*.
		* **Constraints** - what cannot be done with the device.

	* **Understanding**: What does it all mean? How is the product supposed to be used? What do all the different controls and settings mean?
		* The **system image** pertains to the combined information available to us about the device.  It is what can be perceived from the physical structure that has been built.
		* The designer expects the userâ€™s model to be identical to the design model, but because designers cannot communicate directly with users, *the entire burden of communication is on the system image*
		* No matter how brilliant the product, if people cannot use it, it will receive poor reviews

	* Simple devices should be intuitive. They should not require manuals or personal instruction. Many products defy understanding simply because they have too many functions and controls.
	* *It is the duty of machines and those who design them to understand people*. It is not our duty to understand the arbitrary, meaningless dictates of machines

* *All artificial things are designed by definition*. **Design** is concerned with how things work, how they are controlled, and the nature of the interaction between people and technology. 
	* *Good design starts with an understanding of both psychology and technology*. 
	* *The problem with most designers is thinking too logically even when people are not logical*. We have to accept human behavior the way it is, not he way we would wish it to be. 

* **Human Centered Design** -- an approach that puts human needs, capabilities, and behavior first, then designs to accommodate these facets.
	* People themselves are often unaware of their true needs. So, the principle is to *iteratively design* based on approximations of these needs.
	* There is an emphasis on **user experience**, as it is *through experience that people remember their interactions*.
* **The Paradox of Technology**: More benefits imply more complexity which give us more frustration 
* *Design is multidisciplinary* considering facets such as marketability, reliability, and manufacturing.
	* It is when disciplines operate independently of one another that major clashes and deficiencies occur. 
	* The goal of design is to produce a great product, one that is successful, and that customers love.
