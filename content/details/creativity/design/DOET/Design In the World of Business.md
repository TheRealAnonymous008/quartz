* The design of technology to fit human needs and capabilities is determined by the psychology of people. Yes, technologies may change, but people stay the same
# External Forces
* *[[Competition between Firms|Competitive]] pressures drive products, and by extension design*. Three factors that influence competition are price, features, and quality.
* The real business pressures on companies are: the need for speed, the concern about costs, the competition that may force the company to change its offerings, and the need to satisfy several classes of customers and users.
* Additional pressures include the *development cycle of products*, and the restrictions imposed by large organizations, in addition to the complexity with managing them.
* These make it difficult to [[details/creativity/design/DOET/Design Thinking|follow the complete process of design]].

* **Featuritis** - after the product has been available for a while, a number of factors inevitably appear, pushing the company *toward the addition of new features.*, even those outside of the original design or what it is capable of.
	* More customers like the product, but they also *want more features, functions and capabilities*.
	* *Competition* adds new features that aren't in the sold product.
		* *The attempt to match competition causes all products to be the same*. 
		* Most companies compare features with their competition to determine where they are weak
		* Good design requires stepping back from competitive pressures and ensuring that the entire product be consistent, coherent, and
		* **The Customer Obsessed Approach** -- ignore the competition and appeal to what the customers really want.
	* Customers are satisfied, but *the market becomes saturated* so there is a need to expand the feature set to appeal to more people.

* A design is flawed if it cannot be manufactured or marketed.
# Innovation 
* *New technology forces changes*, opening up new design challenges while rendering old devices obsolete.
	* Technology changes rapidly, but people and culture change slowly.
	* Most people do not like changes in conventions. It takes long for what should have been obsolete to die out.
	* Most radical ideas fail: large companies are not tolerant of failure, which is needed to explore the space of possibilities.
	* Failures happen but many are not publicized. Failures can happen due to unpreparedness of the marketplace, the technology, or the company.
	* *Ideas take a long time to go from conception to successful and useful product*. 
		* It is extremely difficult to develop all the details required to ensure that a new idea works, to say nothing of finding components that can be manufactured in sufficient quantity, reliability, and affordability.
		* *Ideas that are too early often fail*, even if eventually others introduce them successfully. [[The 48 Laws of Power#38. Think As You Like But Behave Like Others|People are conservative]].

* Innovation can come **incrementally** or **radically**. The typical case is the incremental one.
	* *Radical innovation changes paradigms*. It changes lives and industries.
		* It starts fresh, driven by new technology.
		* It is as likely to find the best technology as it is with the worst.
		* It entails *redefining* existing technologies and industries.
	* *Incremental innovation makes things better.*
		* This involves continual testing and refinement in a hill-climbing manner (similar to the [[details/creativity/design/DOET/Design Thinking#Design Pipeline|Design Process]]).
		* Hill climbing is unlikely to converge to truly disruptive technology.
# Society
* We are surrounded with objects of desire, not objects of use. *Design has a sociopolitical role* as it meets the wants of people as well.
* *What may be good for business may be bad for the environment*. For example:
	* The business practice of deliberately designing products that fail to sell more,
	* The very notion of things being "in fashion"
	* Subscription-based services.
* The design of everyday things is in great danger of becoming the design of superfluous, overloaded, unnecessary things.
* The rise of small, efficient tools that can empower individuals leads to what Norman calls **the rise of the small**. *Now individuals can do what was traditionally done by only a select few. Technology enables creativity*.
