* **Broken Aesop**
	"Do as I say, not as I do". It involves dissonance between the morals the author was going for, and the morals as they are presented in the story. 
	
	Some common ways of breaking this:
	* [[Non Sequiturs]] instead of using the logical conclusion of the lesson
	* Not practicing what you preach.
	* Inconsistency in the morals applied.
	* Fallacious Aesops (i.e.,  Hard work pays off, yet the heroes are born privileged.)
