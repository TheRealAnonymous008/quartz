* **Bookends** 
	* Begin the story in the same way it ends. It gives a sense of a cyclical story. 
	* Although seemingly no progress is made because the beginning is the end, the real progress is changing the perspective we have on both circumstances. 

* **Boy Meets Girl**
	* A plot structure that goes as follows (note, Boy and Girl are placeholders).
		* Boy meets Girl
		* Boy loses Girl
		* Boy regains Girl.
	* *Subversion*: The relationship is romantic-like but carries dark undertones.
	* *Deconstruction*: Boy never regains Girl, or it is left in the air whether or not Boy regains Girl.
	* *Direction*: "Loses" doesn't necessarily have to be limited to "being separated physically". For example: 
		* "Boy Loses all memory of Girl".
		* "Boy Loses Girl's hand in Marriage"
		* "Boy and Girl are separated by being in different historical periods."
		* "Boy and Girl are separated because one of them is dead"
	* *Direction*: How Boy loses Girl is the inciting incident. How Boy regains Girl drives the progress of the plot.

* **Closed Circle**
	* The characters are forced to stay in a location and get involved with the plot. They are unable to leave until the plot is done.
	* This is applicable to any plot or [[Genre]].
	* *Directions*
		* The location is made inescapable.
		* The characters get lost until they wander into the plot.
		* The characters cannot leave the same way they entered.
		* The characters are under a compulsion to stay (whether forced or their own will).
	* Assuming it isn't too contrived, the closed circle gives additional impetus for why the plot needs to be resolved.

* **Framing Device**
	* A story is surrounded (i.e., framed) by a secondary story. A story within a story.
	* A story within a story. The framing device can serve a world-building role. Alternatively, it can be used to foreshadow or portend events that will happen within the actual story or serve as parallels to the theme of the story.
	* It can also be used to tie elements of the story together (i.e., its themes or the plot in general)
	* It can also highlight whether or not the narrator is a reliable person

* **From Zero to Hero**
	* A plot with the following structure:
		* Hero starts from humble (or impoverished) origins.
		* Hero undertakes a journey with an ultimate goal to achieve. They ultimately succeed in this difficult task.
		* Hero ends the story in a better state than they began.
	* The underdog story that highlights character development for the hero. Many people root for the underdog

* **Hidden First Act Parallel**
	* The situation from the first act serves as the allegory or metaphor that the rest of the chapter will take on instead of having the plot ease in. 
	* Do this subtly so that audiences can better appreciate the metaphor

* **The Idol's Blessing**
	* An arc structured like this:
		* Character admires or idolizes someone, wanting to follow in their footsteps.
		* Character sucks at following their idol
		* Their idol personally steps in and endorses the character's success, and thus their journey supported by the idol begins.
