* **Happy Ending Override**
	* The situation in the current act is worse compared to the happy ending of the previous act.
	* This is based on the premise that You can't have a story that ends happily ever after permanently.
	* *Danger*: If this is done poorly, the audience will write off the sequel as having never happened.

* **Ignorant of the Call**
	* Everyone except for the hero sees the hero as The Hero chosen by the Call. It is interesting since the types of characters ignorant of the call are those that think nothing of their heroic deeds or view them as part of their job.

* **In Media Res** 
	* Begin in the middle of the plot. This puts the audience in the middle of the plot, and serves as a hook to set the tone and premise of the plot. It can also raise questions for the audience as to how the plot reached that point.

* **Last Day of Normalcy** 
	* Begin the story before the characters are plunged into the plot. It serves as a contrast between how the characters were in their ordinary lives in the Known world (see [[Plot|Hero's Journey]]), and how they are changed in the Unknown World.
	
* **Prolonged Prologue** 
	* Begin the story with a prologue that takes up a significant percentage of the work. It is interesting because it can work even though it defies the standard rule of "get to the plot quickly". 
	* It becomes good when it serves as a mini-story with its own promises and payoffs congruent to the main plot's, and which engagingly introduces the premise of the work.

*  **Rescue Introduction**
	* An introduction structured like this:
		* Protagonist is attacked or beaten up to the point where there is no hope of survival, alternatively, they are in a tricky situation
		* Good Samaritan discovers Protagonist in a bad state 
		* Good Samaritan rescues Protagonist or nurses them back to health.
		* Say [I Found You Like This](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IFoundYouLikeThis)
	* It Introduces the Good Samaritan as a character, and establish a bond with them and the Protagonist.

* **Stumbled into the Plot** 
	* An everyman finds the inciting incident of the plot and ends up becoming the protagonist of the story. It highlights a scale on how to introduce the character to the plot--on one end, it is completely coincidental, on the other, they were destined for it.

* **The Call Knows Where You Live** 
	* The Call to Adventure is persistent in that even if the protagonist repeatedly refuses, it still finds a way to enter the protagonist and affect them negatively. This gives interesting character motivations such as guilt for the protagonist's negligence.

* **When it All Began** 
	* A single very significant moment related to the fate of every single main character and driving the entire plot. It greatly ties together all the involved characters and makes the world feel more cohesive. Can embody the Butterfly Effect as well as give an Origin story.
