# Scenes and Beats
* Treat scenes as mini-arcs. The same methods in writing plot apply. *Run action sequences as mini-stories with an established motivation, back-and-forths, and a resolution*.
* Scenes turn because of actions or revelations. Something must be done, or new insight must be gained. 
### Turning Points
* Strive to write scenes which are a display of minor, moderate, or major turning points -- where story values change and something meaningful changes.
* Turning points lead to: *surprise, increased curiosity, insight, and new direction*. 
	* Surprise comes from the dissonance between audience expectation and reality.
	* Curiosity comes from the audience asking "why?"
	* Insight comes from the audience's introspection based on what they have seen so far in the story, developing a deeper appreciation.
	* Each new bit of insight and objective reality in the story points to a new direction the story can take.
* *To tell a story is to tell a promise*. Insight is the audience's reward for paying attention.
* *Our most powerful means of self-expression is the unique way we turn the story*.

### Setup / Payoff
* To **setup** is to place knowledge in the story. To **payoff** is to close the gap between expectation and result by delivering knowledge to the audience.
	* Satisfying setup takes on a new meaning once the payoff has been delivered.
	* Satisfying setup must strike a balance between not being too subtle to be missed, but too heavy-handed to be obvious and render the story predictable.
* Proper payoff means that the audience can look back on the story told so far and think that they can spontaneously discover all the insights hidden in the story.
	* Payoff in itself can set up a new scene.
* In storytelling, you can setup what may seem absurd, and then make it rational. *Reasoning is secondary and post creativity Primary to everything else is imagination*.
### Emotional Dynamic
* We render a precise experience necessary to cause an emotion.
* As audience, we experience an emotion when the telling takes us through a transition of values. Feelings make emotions specific.
	* *Story must create dynamic alterations between positive and negative emotion in order to obey the Law of Diminishing Returns*. Thus, the first time of experiencing an emotion that is in full effect.
	* Thus *vary emotions* throughout the story. Don't just hit one emotional note.
* *We can use mood to set audience anticipation*. Emotions determine the arc of the scene. Mood makes it more specific.
### Choice
* Turning points are centered around a choice a character makes under pressure
* *Choices are byproducts of dilemmas* -- choices between irreconcilable goods or the lesser evil. Simple moral choices are not interesting to watch.
* To construct and create genuine choice, frame a three-sided situation. This is in service of avoiding repetition that makes the choice feel boring for the audience.
* *An original work poses choices between unique but irreconcilable desire. Choice must be between either positive desires or negative desires of equal weight and value.* 
### Beats
* The flaws of an ill-designed scene lie in its story beats--what is shown (text) and what is implied (subtext).
	* When we say writing is "on the nose", it means that *we are writing only the text not the subtext. The scene is about what it is about.* 
	* *Subtext gives the characters more life*--true to life, there is a duality between conscious and unconscious, but unlike life, *stories give the audience the opportunity to read the subtext.*
		* Remember: *characters never act the complete truth*.
* More beats = Audience is more grounded on the scene. The subtext becomes more important. Less beats = More attention on the dialogue.
### Scene Analysis
* Consider this procedure to analyze a scene:
	* *Define conflict*: Who drives the scene, motivates it, and makes it happen? What do they desire? What forces of antagonism blocks this desire? What does this antagonistic force want?
		* It is preferable if the antagonist's desire conflicts directly with the protagonist's
		* Conflict should be apparently relevant to the characters' motivations and desires, not conflict that the audience knows will be a problem later but not now.
	* *Note Opening Value*: What story value is at stake in the scene? What is this value's state at the beginning of the scene? 
	* *Identify beats*: What are the actions / reactions in the characters' behaviors? A beat is defined by a change in behavior. 
		* Outwardly: What do characters seem to be doing?
		* Inwardly: What are the characters actually doing? Describe this not only through actions but through the character's emotions and thoughts
	* *Note Closing Value and Compare with Opening Value*: What is the situation at the end of the scene? Compare the story values at the end of the scene with those from the beginning? What changed? 
		* If nothing changed, nothing happened. 
	* *Survey Beats and Locate Turning Point*: Scenes play like arcs, so locate the point where a gap between expectation and result appears. This is the turning point. Is the turning point in an appropriate place? Not too early or too late? 
# Scene Composition
* The process of creating sequences by ordering and linking scenes together.
### Unity and Variety
* A story, even when expressing chaos, must be unified. It must make sense to say: "Because of X, Y had to happen."
* Within unity, induce as much variety as possible to make the story feel fresh. Touch on different aspects. Explore different perspectives. Add humor.

### Pacing
* Remember: too much tension, the story feels chaotic. Too much relaxation, the story feels boring.
* Pacing means to alternate between dramatic tension and relaxation. The story should not run with dramatic pressure held constant. 

### Rhythm and Tempo
* Rhythm is set by the length of the scene -- How long are we in the same time and place? More importantly, how often do scenes happen? 
* Tempo is the level of activity within a scene via dialogue, action or a combination. 
* In a well-told story, progression accelerates pace--shorter scenes with more action towards the climactic moment that is long, slow, and tense. 
	* Law of Diminishing returns applies. The more often you  slow pace, the less of an impact the next slow paced scene becomes.

### Progression
* When a story progresses, it calls upon greater and greater change. Expectations heighten as length increases. We can express this progression in different ways: 

* **Social Progression** - widen the impact of the character actions into the story. *Progress from personal to societal / universal*. 
* **Personal Progression** - drive actions deeply into the intimate relationships and inner lives of the characters.  *Progress from outer self to inner self*. 
* **[[Symbolism|Symbolic]] Ascension** - build the symbolic change of the story's imagery from the particular to the universal. *Progress from having symbolic elements stand for literal ideas towards universal ideas*.  
* **Ironic Ascension** - turn progression into irony. *Progression comes from showcasing the duality of existence. A reminder life is fickle and complex.*.  Some examples are found in [[$Story by Robert McKee|McKee Ch. 12]]
### Principle of Transition
* Stories without a sense of progression stumble from one scene to the next -- there is little continuity.
* The **transition** is a hinge between two scenes -- something held in common by them or counterpointed between them (characterizations, actions, objects, words, atmosphere, setting, ideas).
