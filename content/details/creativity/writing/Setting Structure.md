* Knowledge of, and insight into the world of the story is fundamental to the achievement of originality and excellence.

* A story's **setting** consists of the following aspects.
	* **Period** - the story's place in time.
	* **Duration** - the story's length throughout time.
	* **Location** - the story's place in space.
	* **Level of Conflict** - the story's position in the hierarchy of human struggles. 
* Setting defines and confines the possibilities within a story. What is told is defined by what is probable within the setting--its rules.
	* The audience will feel violated when you break these rules once they have understood them.
* *Be specific -- an honest story is at home in one, and only one place and time*. 
	* Remember: [[Creativity|creativity necessitates setting limitations]], limitations make your world more knowable (satisfying [[Worldbuilding|Sanderson's laws]]).
	* Take the time to perform research
		* **Research from Memory** - "What do I know from personal experience that touches on my characters' lives?". Thus, formulate a scene.
		* **Research from Imagination**  - "What would it be like to live my character's life?". Thus, unravel hidden connections
		* **Research From Fact** - Research from the world around you. Add to your working knowledge.
	* However, constrain yourself. Research is not an end but a means. Do not get worldbuilding sickness.
