* **Conceptual Blocks** are mental walls that block the problem solver from correctly perceiving a problem or conceiving its [[Problem Solving|solution]]. 
## Perceptual Blocks
* Obstacles that prevent the problem solver from clearly perceiving either the problem itself or the information needed to solve the problem.
* *Example*: [[False Priors|Stereotypes]] and [[Extension Neglect]]. They inhibit creativity because we view things with a narrow mind.
* It is the material in our [[Faculties of the Mind#Memory|long term memory]] which allows us to solve problems. It is this material that we have direct our attention to. 
	* A narrow mind is biased towards not putting perceived unpleasant things in long term memory.
	* Putting things in long term memory depends on context. We do not put things in LTM when we perceive that it doesn't make sense or we lack context for it. *Context makes it easier to commit to LTM*
	* When we do recall, the residual context accompanies the information. *The residual information that accompanies recall needs to be addressed*
	* We dismiss information that categorically is not related to what is presented to us. In other words [[Cognitive Dissonance]].
* *Example*: Inadequate or misleading information which hinders our ability to isolate the problem.
	* Thus *make sure to solve the right problem, if it even exists.*
	* Difficulty in isolating the problem is often due to the tendency to spend a minimum of effort on the problem definition to get to the important matter of solving the problem.
* *Example*: The tendency to delimit the problem area poorly.
	* We often impose constraints that were never there to begin with.
	* We need to realize what constraints we have and recognize whether they are actually a characteristic of the problem or in our own head.
	* *The [[Framing Effect|framing]]  of a problem has great influence on the solution of it.*
	* *More broad problem statement= more conceptualization. Less broad problem statement = less creativity*
	* It is also possible to not constrain the problem at all -- *too broad problem statement = solution that is too generic*.
	* As limits on the problem-definition are relaxed, one usually becomes involved in interdisciplinary considerations.
* *Example*: Inability to see the problem from various viewpoints.
	* The interests of other people affected by the problem must be considered.
	* Everything is [[System Opportunities|interconnected]], therefore problems are very often cross-cutting with many ways to frame it (and thus many ways to solve it)
* *Example*: **Saturation**. This occurs when the mind recorded all inputs so that they were all consciously accessible without keeping in mind how they may be recalled.
	* *We think we have the data even though we are unable to produce it when needed*. 
	* Saturation also comes in due to noisy data.
* *Example*: Failure to utilize all sensory inputs. 
	* One technique to avoid this is to remove certain sensory inputs to make sure that other sensory inputs are accounted for.

## Emotional Blocks
* Conceptualization is perceived as [[Prospect Theory|risky]] and thus, new ideas are hard to evaluate. Sometimes *explaining an idea to someone makes us feel embarrassed* 
* [[Emotion]] is inherently difficult to understand

* Humans create for reasons of inner drive.
* At least part oof creativity occurs in the part of the mind below the conscious level.
* Although creativity and neuroses may stem from the same source, creativity tends to flow best in the absence of neuroses.
* The conscious mind is a control valve on creativity.
* Creativity can provoke anxieties.

* *Example*: Fear of taking risks, to make mistakes, or to fail. 
	* A by-product of being rewarded for being correct and punished for making mistakes.
	* The fears that inhibit conceptualization are often not based upon a realistic assumption of the consequences.
	* Thus, we need to *realistically assess the possible negative consequences of an idea*. 
	* Ask yourself: *If everything went wrong, what will happen?*

* *Example*: A lack of appetite for chaos. The inability to tolerate ambiguity; overriding desire for order. 
	* Remember that the solution to a complex problem is a messy process.
	* Obsessive compulsiveness hinders the ability to work with certain types of problems because it hinders the ability for disparate ideas to coexist in a messy fashion.

* *Example*: Judging rather than generating ideas
	* Judgment applied too early or too indiscriminately in the problem solving process is detrimental to conceptualization.
	* Analyzing or judging too early leads to many ideas being rejected.
		* Ideas require time to mature
		* Ideas spawn other ideas. Rejecting one may reject many possibilities.

* *Example*: Inability or Unwillingness to Incubate
	* Incubation in this context pertains to letting a problem rest in your mind until suddenly a "better" answer appears unconsciously.
	* *Allow your mind to struggle with problems over time. Allocate time to incubate a solution. Relax*

* *Example*: Lack of challenge versus excessive zeal
	* You cannot do your best on a problem unless you are motivated. However, excessive motivation to succeed (esp. quickly) inhibits the creative problem.
	* However, challenge must be present for at least some of the time so that the process is rewarding.

* *Example*: Perceptions of reality and fantasy
	* The creative person needs to control their imagination. The imagination becomes more potent if you allow other sensory data.
	* Imagine not only complex images, but also manipulate them and recombine them from experience.
	* *Fantasize freely and vividly, but distinguish reality from fantasy*. 
	* The imagination must be set free of the constraints placed upon real acts and events.

* *Example*: Angst
	* Seek a [[Flow State Model|flow state]] and maintain it. 
	* We are more likely to be creative if we love the things we are doing and we are more likely to spend time in the flow state.

## Cultural and Environmental Blocks
* There are two aspects to creativity (according to J.P. Guilford)
	* **Fluency** - the number of concepts one produces in a given length of time
	* **Flexibility** - the diversity of the ideas generated.

* *Example* Taboos
	* Cultural taboos can eliminate entire families of solutions from the ready grasp of the problem solver.
	* If you are working on problems within the privacy of your own mind, you do not have to be concerned with violating taboos
	* A good example of a taboo: Playfulness being for children only. In reality *Playfulness and Whimsy are vital for problem solvers*

* *Example* Problem solving being serious business. 
	* One of the essentials of creative thinking is bringing ideas together that are not ordinarily combined.
	* Humor is not so different from being creative. They require bringing seemingly disparate ideas together.
	* Humor also decreases perceptions of risk.

* *Example*: Reason being perceived as good. Intuition being perceived as bad. 
	* Effective conceptualization requires the problem solver to be able to incorporate both reason and intuition -- logic and feeling.
	* Stereotyping people based on if they are more "reason"-focused or "feeling"-focused does not help and hinders their creative potential.
	* [[Science|Scientific thinking can only solve problems based on an established understanding]]. Left-handed thinking is more suited for problems with high complexity or social / emotional content *Both are important*.

* *Example*: The belief that "everyone should be like me"
	* The inability to see other people's viewpoints results in premature judgment and instantaneous opposition.
	* It inherently restricts creativity because it limits perspective.
* The best creative work comes from people who are not only electronically interconnected but also share cultural values and interact personally in some physical space

* *Example*: Tradition is preferable to change.
	* Unless you are not convinced that change is needed in a particular area, you are not likely to hypothesize ways of accomplishing that change.
	* *The problem comes from individuals not seeing a problem and how desirable a solution would be*

* Education is also correlated with this -- Students who are part of a culture that values grades or views the professors as the authority struggle with creativity.
	* They are more preoccupied with "What is the answer" than going against the grain.
	* Academic risk taking is seen as a taboo.

* *Example*: Distractions.
	* Our physical environment affects our creative process, yet the effect is different per individual
	* *Create an environment that is conducive to our own needs.*
	* However, the most important environmental blocks are cultural or emotional.

* *Example*: Attitudes towards criticism
	* An atmosphere of honesty, trust, and support is necessary if most people are to make the best of their conceptual abilities
	* Accept and incorporate criticism. Most people are not happy with criticism and are unsure of the quality of their own ideas.
	* Competitive environments are not conducive for conceptualization.

* *Example*: Autocratic Bosses
	* Autocratic bosses do not make use of the conceptual abilities of their subordinates. 
	* An environment with an autocratic boss or group leader is not conducive for conceptualization.

* *Example*: Lack of support
	* Ideas require time and money to realize. 
	* All ideas require an environment that will produce the support necessary to bring them to fruition.

## Intellectual and Expressive Blocks
* Intellectual blocks result in an inefficient choice of mental tactics. 
* Expressive blocks inhibit the ability to [[Communication|communicate]] ideas -- both to others and yourself.

* *Example*: Choosing the incorrect problem solving language.
	* Without conscious thought, a strategy (problem solving language) will be chosen by the mind. The key is *to select the correct problem solving language to aid in this*
	* The most common language we choose is Verbal Thinking -- it gives the illusion that we have an answer when, in reality, we do not.
	* *Our reaction to intellectual problems  does not necessarily reflect our present ability to solve them*. 
	* We may find that the process is less painful than we thought, or that we have had some fluency with the problem solving language all along. for as long as we actually start.
	* *Our habitual choice of problem solving languages may be consciously overcome*. 
		* The first step is usually to realize that these habits are inadequate.
		* The second step is to consciously analyze and learn.
		* Then build a new habit and practice until it becomes natural.
		* Finally recognize that the process will repeat.

* *Example*: Inflexibility when it comes to choice of strategy
	* A strategy can be thought of as a rationale or purpose behind your actions. 
	* Spend some conscious effort thinking about strategies 
		* By selecting strategies, consciously, you can find approaches you would never have known.
		* By becoming aware of various thinking strategies, you give your mind a wider range to select from and integrate into its unconscious.
		* See more about problem solving strategies [[Problem Solving Strategies|here]]

* *Example*: Lack of, or incorrect, information
	* Incorrect information propagates throughout the solution.
	* Regardless of what information we have, it is recommended to approach a problem with a "clean" unbiased mind. Past information can sometimes prevent us from seeing alternatives.

* *Example*: Communication barriers
	* Communication is difficult in situations involving creativity.
	* It becomes even more difficult when we have to communicate across disciplines. 
	* A reluctance to asking questions (because asking questions is perceived as an admission of ignorance) is also a barrier. 
	* *Make efforts to have two-way communication and with adequate time and effort*
