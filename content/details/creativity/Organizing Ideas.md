* Without an organizational system for your ideas, you'll always struggle to make them happen. The key is to use [[UX Design Principles|Design-centric principles]] to [[Faculties of the Mind|motivate]] oneself throughout the creative process

* The **Bullet Journal Method** is built upon *Tracking the Past; Organizing the Present; Planning The Future*. It posits three questions
	* Is this vital?
	* Does it matter? 
	* What would happen if I didn't do this? 

* Use a **Second Brain**. The idea is to dump all of your knowledge into a repository and then organize bits of knowledge by finding connections between them.

* The **Action Method**. All projects can be reduced to these three components
	* *Action Steps* - the specific concrete tasks that let you make progress, even if it's a little progress.
	* *References* - any project-related documents you may wish to refer back to. They are not actionable but they serve as good references.
	* *Backburner Ideas* - things that are not actionable now but may be someday.

* *Say no to everything not aligned with your essential priorities. Prioritize what is important over what is urgent*.
