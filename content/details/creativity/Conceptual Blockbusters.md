# Thinking Languages
* Analogous to [[The Language of Patterns|pattern languages]] but for ideation. *The problem solver is fluent in many mental languages and can use them interchangeably to record information, communicate with the unconscious, and consciously manipulate*.

* **Verbal thinking** is the most common thinking language. It is easy to communicate the problem and its solution. However, many problems are not solvable with verbal thinking.

* [[Mathematics]] is another thinking language generally well suited for complex systems, quantities, relationships, and so forth. The benefit of mathematics is in abstraction and precision.

* **Visualization** is especially useful in solving patterns which concern shapes, forms, or patterns. Bob McKim states there are three kinds of visual imagery necessary in effective visual thinking
	* **Perceptual Imagery** - sensory experience of the real world. People tend to not see everything by default. 
		* It requires conscious effort to "see better" 
		* [[details/arts/Drawing|Drawing]] improves our ability too "see" things better.
	* **Mental Imagery** - constructed in the mind and utilizes information from perceptual imagery. It has two important aspects:
		* **Clarity** - how sharp and detailed are the images. Clarity depends on our "seeing" ability.
		* **Control** - how well can the mental images be manipulated. Control depends on practice (i.e. practicing fantasizing)
	* **Graphic Imagery** - imagery that is sketched or drawn. Can be divided into two 
		* Drawing to communicate with others
		* Drawing to communicate with oneself.

* Visualization extends to **Sensory Languages** as well. Not just sight but also hearing, smell, taste, and feel.

* Aside from thinking languages, we also have **cognitive styles**  which reflect our preferred ways of thinking.
	* Specialization is good both for our psychological wellbeing (it fuels our ego) and society at large. 
	* However, specialization has a downside -- it hinders creativity because it is only focused on one perspective.
	* *Broadening one's vocabulary of and exposure problem solving styles is a good way to increase creativity*

	* **Analysis** involves the separation of the whole into parts to discover the characteristics of the parts and their relationship with each other.
	* **Synthesis** refers to putting parts together into a whole to satisfy a goal.
	* Aim to use both analysis and synthesis.  The overall purpose of analysis is to allow for better synthesis. At the same time, synthesis benefits from analysis.

	* **[[details/creativity/design/DOET/Design Thinking|Convergent Thinking]]** focuses on an answer to a problem. 
	* **Divergent Thinking** focuses on generating ideas, concepts and approaches.
	* Aim to use both Convergent and Divergent thinking. Divergent thinking alone continues to generate ideas without and goal. Convergent thinking alone excludes examining better alternatives.

	* **Deduction** involves reasoning from general to specific. From theory to specific facts.
	* **Induction** involves reasoning from specific to general. 
	* Competent problem solving requires both Deduction and Induction. Sometimes a theory will not be available and we need to use induction. Sometimes we are studying a case of a more widely known theory and so deduction is necessary.

* *Encourage diversity of thought and cognitive styles*. 

# Blockbusters
* The goal is to remove the [[Conceptual Blocks to Ideation]] that hinder our creativity.
* The first step is to identify our conceptual blocks.

* *Example*: A questioning attitude.
	* Adults tend to lose the questioning attitude they had as children. They are discouraged from inquiry and they are encouraged to be smart (equated to amount of knowledge possessed). Questions are seen as a sign of a lack of knowledge.
	* *A questioning attitude is necessary for conceptualization*. One has no reason to innovate if they already accept the status quo.
	* *Start questioning and lay your ignorance out in the open. No one is omniscient* 

* *Example*: Working on the right problem
	* We tend to work on the problems which are more apparent than the core problems that are really there.
	* One exercise that helps with this: draw the dependency graph between problems. What is the root cause of all problems?  *Are we working on the core problems (where all problems flow out of) or are we merely working on symptoms (where all problems flow into)*

* *Example*: Time and Effort Focusers.
	* Make lists.
	* Use Brainstorming techniques
	* Use a time limit to force yourself to not throw away ideas. When making lists, aim to generate as many ideas as possible. 

* *Example*: Set Breakers. 
	* The aim is to divert us from accepting the answer that first comes to mind.
	* One approach is too list all the attributes of an object.
	* We can extend this to finding alternates of each attribute and mixing and matching.
	* *Innovation is merely a matter of new ways of combining old bits and pieces.*
	* The **Bug List** - list down small, specific ideas to spark ideas for inventions. If you run out of ideas you are hitting  a block.
	* The **Checklist** - Assemble alternate concepts together. It especially helps if the list used encourages playfulness.
	* *Interact with other people*. In fact, [[The 48 Laws of Power#7. Get Others To Do The Work For You But Always Take The Credit|Steal other people's ideas]] 
	* *Interact across disciplines*. It helps expand one's perspective on one problem.
	* Interact across cultures and change the environment.

* *Postpone judgment*  Ideas require time to mature. Ideas may lead to more ideas. Therefore, do not throw them away immediately.
	* Consciously suspend judgment (i.e., say to yourself that you will generate ideas and suspend judgment or establish rules to yourself that permit you to not immediately reject outlandish ideas)
	* An active brainstorming session with others also helps with this.
