* [A Project of One's Own](http://www.paulgraham.com/own.html)
	* Have a project you want to work on and "own". This has more value than projects you are told to do.
	* Your own projects are those you do voluntarily and which you work on yourself actively without being bogged down by bureaucracy.
	* Work-life balance is a misnomer. Work on something you want to take your life over. 
	* Retain the child-like confidence to simply play around and explore.
* [Heresy](http://www.paulgraham.com/heresy.html)
	* We live in an age where heresy still exists.. Heresy:
		* Takes priority over veracity
		* Outweighs everything else that the speaker has done.
		* Implicitly shuts down any further argument from the heretic.
		* It is an opinion whose expression is treated like a crime.
	* Even if a statement is x-ist, it is fallacious to think that it is true or false. 
	* Heresy is rampant due to the aggressively conventional mobbing together under one ideology--one with arbitrary rules that imply superiority.
* [Is There Such a Thing as Good Taste?](http://www.paulgraham.com/goodtaste.html)

	* People can be passive or aggressive; conventional or independent-minded. Most are passively conventional minded. 
	* Much of this stance towards conformism is based on ones' personality.
	* Aggressive Conventional mindedness only serves to cause stagnation within society.
	* Society needs to be reminded of bad ideas from the independent-minded.
* [The Lesson to Unlearn](http://www.paulgraham.com/lesson.html)
	* Learning to get good grades is the antithesis of actual learning.
	* The vast majority prioritize good grades because of how society has placed value on them.
	* School indirectly teaches you to miss the obvious and overthink because learning in school requires more mental gymnastics than actual learning.
