* *Opinion*: Junji ito really captures a lot of the horror that comes from just being human. A lot of [[Information Hazards]].

* [Army of One](https://ww7.mangakakalot.tv/chapter/manga-sc969959/chapter-6.5) - what happens when our need for social interaction and connection is turned against us, to the extreme.
	* "Nobody likes a lonely only. Everybody join hands now. Everybody join hearts now. Everyone's your friend. When you join hearts and sing -- Army of One. We're an Army of One".

* [Glyceride](https://imgur.com/gallery/LaVdb) - the horror of familial abuse, or in general how hatred leads to more hatred. The "saturation level" in the story is a metaphor for this. At the same time, it also examines the circumstances that lead to these situations -- poverty that drives someone to desparation.

* [Hanging Balloons](https://ww7.manganelo.tv/chapter/manga-kf961388/chapter-24) - when one suicide causes a chain reaction of suicides all around the country. A metaphor for suicidal thoughts and ideation that floats around society even if we don't acknowledge their presence (until it's too late).

* [Hellstar Remina](https://ww7.mangakakalot.tv/chapter/manga-sc969959/chapter-1) - an illustration of man's potential for zealous madness in the face of the apocalypse. Really highlights the irrationality of man when under immense crisis.

* [Lovesickness](https://ww7.manganelo.tv/chapter/manga-kf961388/chapter-85) - shows how we all crave love -- even from people who may not reciprocate this love back or worse twist this love for their own sadistic pleasure. Especially true given the parasocial phenomenon nowadays.
	* "If you want to be rid of your problems, find a bigger problem...Because if you find a bigger problem then your current problem would seem inconsequential wouldn't it?"
	* The ending has a hopeful tone. If love is powerful enough to corrupt, then it is equally powerful enough to give someone hope to live another day.

* [The Enigma of Amigara Fault](https://comick.app/comic/the-enigma-of-amigara-fault/Yl0g9) - the premise is simple: people are compelled to force themselves into a hole that is "in their shape". This applies to society too, where we are pressured to conform, even if it means we distort ourselves in the process.
	* "This is my hole. It was made for me."

* [The Human Chair](https://imgur.com/gallery/lOlu2qV) - to what extent would a man go to to receive affection -- make himself a chair.
