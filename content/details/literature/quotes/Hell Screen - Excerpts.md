* His (Yoshihide's) wide eyes open, his distorted lips, and the quivering of his cheek were tangible expressions of the dread, grief and bewilderment which crowded upon his mind.

* "Yoshihide, who survived the untimely death of his only beloved daughter, could no longer find it in his heart to live on in this world" - `Narrator`
