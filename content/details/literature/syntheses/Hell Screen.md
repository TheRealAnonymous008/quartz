* The most graphic depiction in the Hell Screen is the one which resonated with Yoshihide the most, for it is depicting the loss of something precious to him.
* The style of the narration is told through the eyes of an unreliable narrator (as if talking about gossip).
* It is a story which explores to what extent an artist should devote themselves to their art.
	* As remarked in the story, art is meaningless without certain values the artist adheres to.
* *Remark* The monkey and the painter are two separate entities both called "Yoshihide" yet, it can be interpreted as two sides to the real Yoshihide.
	* The monkey side is simply the one teased by others, yet genuinely loves his daughter. As the monkey dies in the fire, so to does Yoshihide.
	* The artist side is the one obsessed with the Hell Screen and of creating the perfect artwork.
