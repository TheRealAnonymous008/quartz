* *Traditional [[Science]], in part due to the depth of knowledge in each branch, has only been concerned with the parts of a system but not the collective whole*. Systems science aims to go beyond boundaries and explore the bigger picture.  
* *Systems inquiry views phenomena as a web of relationships among elements that thereby constitute a system*
* *It is our brain's natural tendency to perceive a lack of order as a lack of a system*. We are hardwired for pattern recognition but, when closed minded, we can also become locked in a particular frame of mind
