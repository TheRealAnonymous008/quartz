* *Traditional [[Science]], in part due to the depth of knowledge in each branch, has only been concerned with the parts of a system but not the collective whole*. Systems science aims to go beyond boundaries and explore the bigger picture.  
* *Systems inquiry views phenomena as a web of relationships among elements that thereby constitute a system*


# Principles of Systems 
* [^1] A **system** is an interconnected set of elements that is coherently organized in a structure, and which produces a characteristic set of behaviors. This is its **function** (for human-based systems) or **purpose** (for-non-human based systems)
* A system is more than the sum of its parts. The *elements* of a system are usually the easiest parts to notice.

## Systemness
* Systems can be *nested* -- containing smaller subsystems. 
* Changing a system's elements, interconnections or purposes *changes* its behavior.
* As new levels of complex organization emerge, the new levels intertwine in dynamic systemic relationships with other levels. In particular we can consider four levels 
	* **Ontological** - systems in the world / observable universe. This is what the Natural Sciences study 
	* **[[Epistemology|Epistemological]]** - systems in the mind  These are formed in the brain. This is studied by the Social Sciences
	* **Abstract** - [[Mathematics]] or symbolic [[Linguistics|langauge]] aspect. 
	* **Software** -  systems in software.

## Processes 
* *Systems are Processes Organized in Structural and Functional Units
* The least obvious part of the system, its *function or purpose*, is often the most crucial determinant of the systemâ€™s behavior, and it can only be deduced by examining this behavior. 
* System *structure* is the source of system behavior. System behavior reveals itself as a series of events over time. The structure comes from interrelated stocks, flows, and feedback loops.

## Networks 
* *Systems are [[Graph Theory|networks]] of relations among components and can be represented abstractly as such network of relations*. 
* Many of the *interconnections* in systems operate through the flow of information (via decisions or actions) or resources. These serve to hold the system together and determines how it operates. 

## Dynamic 
* *Systems are dynamic over multiple spatial and time scales*. 
* Systems constantly adjust themselves by feedback loops , but when interdependent components operate with feedback loops of different temporal scales, the system may become unstable

## Complexity 
* *Systems exhibit various kinds and levels of complexity*. 
* Complexity and nonlinearity can, themselves, be sources of disruption or failure.
* The purpose of a system may be *emergent* and even accidental -- as in no actor intends for such to happen but the structure of the system makes it so. 

## Evolving 
* *Systems evolve*. Either towards higher organizations, maintaining a steady-state, or decaying.
* The evolution of systems is based on its flows. When inflows are too low, entropy takes over and the system deteriorates towards disorder 

## Information 
* *Systems encode knowledge and receive and send information*. 
* The system, by its very own structure, knows how to react to a situation.

## Regulation 
* *Systems have regulatory subsystems to achieve stability*. 
* As systems evolve toward greater complexity, the interactions between different levels of subsystems require coordination and control in the form of feedback loops

## Models of Others 
* *Systems can contain models of other systems*. 
* Systems and subsystems can expect certain forms of systemic relations to be present. In general, systems encode in some form models of the environment or aspects of the environment with which they interact

## Models of Themselves 
* *Sufficiently Complex, Adaptive Systems Can Contain Models of Themselves*
* Adaptive systems can modify their models of an environment and of themselves to better adapt to the dynamics of the environment 

## Understandability 
* *Systems can be understood* 
* In principle systems function in terms of relational dynamics , and this is an appropriate object for human understanding Systems afford predictability by constructing and testing models 

## Improvability 
* *Systems can be improved*. 
* Systems account of evolution will have to take up the question of when and how causal functioning gets to the condition where the operation of the system can be observed to aim selectively at some kind of result.
