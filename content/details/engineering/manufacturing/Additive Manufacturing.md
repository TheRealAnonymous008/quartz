* Also known as **3D Printing**
* Has an advantage over traditional subtractive manufacturing methods in that it can handle complex geometries and customizable products with minimal waste.
* On the other hand, when compared to subtractive manufacturing, additive manufacturing is less suitable for mass production, especially of products. It benefits less from [[Economics|economies of scale]] compared to subtractive manufacturing.


* The typical workflow of an Additive Manufacturing Process is as follows
	* *Design and [[Blender|Model]]* the print object. Design should take into consideration the technology to be used for the Additive Manufacturing Process.
	* *Convert to an STL file*. An STL (stereolithography) file captures information that can be interpreted by 3D printers and used for building objects. The process is similar to that of [[Basic Rendering and the Rendering Pipeline|rendering]] .
	* *Slicing* - the STL file is transformed into a series of thin horizontal layers called slices. This also includes generating **G-Codes** which are low level instructions for controlling the printer. 
	* *Printing* - the G-codes are fed to the printer and the printing process is initiated, translating the model into a physical object. 

# Misc
* **4D printing** involves printing objects that can change shape or function in response to stimuli. Involves the use of smart materials as the print material.
