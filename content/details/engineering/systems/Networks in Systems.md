* Everything is interconnected. 
* Not all connections are equal.

* As in Network Science, we represent the connections between components as a [[Fundamental Constructs of Graph Theory|graph]]. However, do note that vertices in a network are components, and therefore [[Universal Properties of Systems|decomposable into further subsystems]]. 
* *Networks are not solely governed by physical interactions. Connections can be logical as well.* In the case of a logical network, nodes correspond to [[Systems and Models|concepts]]. 
* *Networks can either be fixed or changing* 
	* **Fixed Networks** abstract the structure of the network (based on the features one is studying).
	* **Dynamic Networks** involve either structural changes or the flow of material, energy and information between nodes (see [[System Dynamics|here for more]]).
	  
	  In fact we can use networks to model the [[Flow Network|flow]] of material between nodes.

* Networks can either be homogeneous or heterogeneous in their nodes and edges.

* Modeling a system as a network lends itself well to computational analysis and optimization.
# Universal Attributes 
* [[Fundamental Constructs of Network Science|Density and Coupling Strength]]
	* Density, in the case of flow networks, relates to how many pathways there are directly (with no intermediate nodes) from one node to another
	* Coupling determines the strength of [[Universal Properties of Systems|Coupling between systems]] (i.e. strength of forces or flows).
	  
	  *Coupling determines the dynamics of the system*

* Networks can grow or evolve over time [^growth] . 
	* This simply means nodes or edges are added, changed, or removed. 
	* The structure of a network can follow certain patterns based on both the density and the coupling.  
		* [[Small World Networks]] and especially [[Scale Free Network]]
		* The existence of hubs which connect to a lot of notes.
		* The link distribution for hubs and [[Network Communities|clusters]] follows an inverse power law. 
		* The growth of hubs and clusters follow a simple rule -- *nodes with more connections attract more new connections*. That is, growth exhibits a positive feedback loop.

[^growth]: See [[Models for Scale Free Networks|here for examples]]

* Linkages , physical or logical, determine the structure of a system internally.
	* Physical links determine physical structures 
	* Relational links determine logical structures
