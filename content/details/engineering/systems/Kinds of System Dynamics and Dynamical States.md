# System Dynamics
## Motion and Interaction
* The system does not change structure or function but the [[Universal Properties of Systems|components]] interact. 
* It also encompasses  the [[Kinematics|Motion]] of a system relative to another.  These systems are otherwise the same, just that they are located at a different position.
* This also includes changes in [[Differential Calculus|rates of interactions]] between subsystems due to diffusion, changes in concentration or the addition or removal of energy in the system. 

## Growth and Shrinkage
* Pertains to an increase or decrease in size of the system per unit time. 
* Growth is sustained by a constantly increasing availability of multiple resources.  Similarly for shrinkage.
* *Growth dynamics are finite in practice because of [[Scarcity, Supply, and Demand|scarcity]]*. 

## Development and Decline
* Development pertains to a programmed change in [[Complex Systems|complexity]] as it reaches maturation. 
* It is complexity either fully realized or complexity deteriorating.
* *Development and Decline are tied to Growth*. They tend to require the addition or removal of material. However, unlike growth, development and decline relate to the structure of the system itself.

## Adaptivity
* Involves a change in the behavior of the system using existing resources in response to an environmental change.
* *Adaptation is necessary for systems that exist in an environment that can change the system.*
* It involves a reallocation of material and resources within the system so that it can respond to the environment better.
* Adaptivity necessitates [[System Control|control systems]] that regulate the process.
* Adaptive Systems use [[Information in Systems|information]] to modify their internal structures to sustain their basic overall structure and functions.
	* Adaptive Systems have the emergent capacity to actively use information to anticipate future states (based on the system's [[Random Variables and Probability Distributions|expectation]] of this state) of the environment.
	* That is, they follow [[Bayesian Statistics|Bayesian methods]] (or an approximation of such), with updates dependent on the amount of information received.
	* Another way to put it *Adaptive systems advance to a future for which they are perfectly prepared*. This is because, no new updates imply no new information received from the environment, which imply no surprise.

* For complex adaptive systems. *Information is the basis for decisions*. Some models for this include:
	* Decision Trees - which assume perfect rationality and perfect information
	* [[Game Theory|Game Theoretic Models]] - which need not assume perfect rationality or perfect information but may be difficult to compute 
	* Using [[False Priors|Heuristics]]  - which are only approximations and may not be optimal, but are easy to compute.

* Adaptive systems may also be **Anticipatory Systems**. That is, they attempt to know the future state based on what is known to be possible. 
	* Anticipation allows the system to alter its behavior to change future states.
	* *Compared to Predictive Systems, Anticipatory Systems are more proactive with regards to the future state.*
	* Anticipation is based on [[Statistical Models|statistical models]] of the world. 
# Dynamical States
## Equilibrium
* **Equilibrium** pertains to a state where energy and matter are uniformly distributed throughout the interior. 
* No work is accomplished internally.
* Any energy flowing in also flows out without affecting the internals.

## Dissipative Systems
* **Dissipative Systems** are those that are subject to [[Stocks and Flows|flows]] that cause the internal state to change.
* They take in, transform, and release energy flows. 
* *These systems are amenable to [[System Evolution|evolution]]* since work and energy tends to go to constructive processes that create new subsystems and organizational structures. 

## Steady State
* **Steady State Systems** pertain to systems where there is energy flow but no new internal structure is being created (on average). 
* The energy that flows into the system is used for maintaining the internal structure of the system. 

## Disturbed Systems
* *All systems structurally expect conditions*. Disturbances to these conditions affect the system
* The degree of adaptation or evolution required from the system to maintain itself tends to be proportional to the magnitude of the disturbance on the system's internal structures. 
	* Of course, if the disturbance hits a critical subsystem, the system may deteriorate or be permanently damaged .

* Complexity tends to be directly proportional to the system's ability to adapt to disturbances.
* A system is **stable** if after a small disturbance, it settles back to the state it was previously in. 
* **Resilience** is the capacity for an active system to rebound to normal function after a disturbance or, if need be, to adapt to a modified function should the disturbance prove to be long-lived.
