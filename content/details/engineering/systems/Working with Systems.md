# Desirable Properties 
* **Resilience** - the ability of the system to survive and persist within a variable environment. 
	* It arises from a rich structure of many feedback loops that can work in different ways to restore a system even after a large [[Perturbation Theory|perturbation]] 
	* The system should have many, different, and potentially redundant balancing loops. 
	* **Meta-resilience** comes from the ability to restore or rebuild feedback loops. 
	* **Meta-meta-resilience** comes from the ability of feedback loops to [[Artificial Intelligence|learn, create and evolve]] complex, restorative, self-organizing structures. 
	* *Resilience does not imply constancy, in fact, rigidity proves to be the opposite of resilience.* 
	* Resilience is not so obvious without a whole-systems view. It is often sacrificed for something short-term. 
	* Resilience expands the possibilities afforded by the system, allowing it to explore more states without destabilizing. 

* **Self-organization** - the capacity of a system to make its own structure more complex. 
	* It produces heterogeneity and unpredictability. It can make new structures, but it requires the [[The Exploitation-Exploration Trade-Off|ability to experiment]]. 
	* These systems diversify and complexify, often from just [[Complex Systems|simple rules]].

* **Hierarchy** - as a consequence of self-organization, a hierarchy emerges. 
	* A complex system can  evolve from a simple system only if there are stable intermediate forms. 
	* They also serve to reduce the amount of information that any part of the system has to keep track of. 
	* They can be taken apart, and the subsystems formed can still function in their own right. 
	* When a system breaks down, it splits along its subsystem hierarchies. Thus, a reductionist point of view has merits in system science (although remember that subsystems also interact with each other)
	* *When a subsystem’s goals dominate at the expense of the total system’s goals, the resulting behavior is called* **suboptimization** [^1]. Of course, there is a [[Trade Offs|balance that must be struck]] between centralized and decentralized approaches
	* Hierarchical systems evolve from the bottom up. The purpose of the upper layers is to serve the purposes of the lower layers. 

[^1]: In other words, it is [[Game Theory - Strategy#Solving Games|not Pareto optimal]]
