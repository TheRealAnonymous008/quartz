* The utility of a system model depends not on whether its driving scenarios are realistic but on whether it responds with a realistic pattern of behavior. 
* *Similar system structures exhibit similar system behaviors*. Similar feedback mechanisms imply similar dynamics. 

* System behaviors can often be surprising. Naive policies on such systems can result in counterintuitive results. 
* Systems always [[Metaphysics|change]]. They do so in different ways and different scales and time.
# The Methodology
* Systems dynamics models explore possible futures and ask [[Data Analytics|what if questions]]. We can test the value of a model by asking ourselves the following: 
	* Are the driving factors likely to unfold this way?
	* If they did, would the system react this way? 
	* What is driving the driving factors? 

* We model the dynamics of a system in two ways
	* **Black Box** - understand the behavior of a system from the outside.
		* In particular, we examine the relation between the system's inputs and outputs
		* In a black box analysis, it is unclear how outputs are derived from inputs.
	* **White Box** - understand the behavior of a system form the inside -- perceiving it as a system of subsystems.
		* It aims to understand how processes inside the system operate
	* We can apply  black box analysis recursively when doing white box analysis. Each subsystem is a black box until we need to examine the processes [^reduc] by using white box analysis. Then, we re-examine how the whole is formed from its individual parts.

[^reduc]: A reductionist process for sure.


* The change of a system can be analyzed using [[Time Series Analysis|time series analysis]]. [[Numerical Methods|Numerical Methods]] are used to perform analysis on a complex system.


#  System Processes
* For all systems to do work, they require [[Work and Energy|work and energy]].  *It is the flow of energy which facilitate the dynamics of the system* -- from how it changes, sustains itself and degrades over time.
	* **Progressive Changes** in the system require a flow of energy and work to be done.
	* **Regressive Changes** result from the irreversible [[Thermodynamics|loss of energy]]. 

* Systems follow the Laws of Thermodynamics.
* If permissible (i.e., if a channel exists), Energy flows from high potential concentration to low potential concentration
	* The difference between potential concentrations is termed the **Gradient**.
* Entropy means that there is always energy loss
	* As a corollary -- *eventually all systems degrade* unless they have a continuous influx of energy to do work and repair damage (which is also impossible due to entropy).
	* Another corollary -- *no system has 100% efficiency*. dd

* *There are no closed systems, except for the universe itself*. Any relationship involves transfers of energy, matter, or messages, and the input involves some kind of output.
* Any minimally complex system must always be subject to the flow of energy; otherwise the processes of natural decay and disorganization will ensue.

* A critical aspect of understanding adaptive dynamic systems is understanding the propagation of change ([[Information Theory|information]]) in the environment
	* *Change propagates both temporally and spatially*.
