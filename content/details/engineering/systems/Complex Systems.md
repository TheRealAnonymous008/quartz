* **Potential Complexity** - a measure of complexity which takes into account: 
	* The number of kinds of components
	* The number of kinds of possible interactions between all combinations of component types
	* The number of objects of each type of component contained within the boundary of the system. 
* **Realized Complexity** - a measure of complexity regarding how the parts are organized, connected, and function together. 
	* It is a challenge for systems science to figure out, with hindsight, the process of transforming, evolving connectivity that has brought about a realized complexity of a system
