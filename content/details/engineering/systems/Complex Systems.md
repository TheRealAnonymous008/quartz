* **Complex Systems** generally have the following properties:
	* They have **emergent** behaviors -- the dynamics are not easily predictable even when the initial conditions remain seemingly the same
	* They require a considerable amount of work be done to [[Systems and Models|understand]] them
	* Complex systems cannot be easily described.

# Defining Complexity 
* One perspective for defining complexity uses [[Networks in Systems|hierarchies]]. There are three kinds
	* **Relational Complexity** - there are many edges in the interaction network of the system.
	* **Compositional Complexity** - the system has many kinds of vertices.
	* **Structural Complexity** - the system is both relationally and compositionally complex. Additionally, there are many kinds of edges representing many possible interactions between components.

* *Having multiple constituent parts is not a prerequisite for complexity.

* The number of levels of organization from the atomic elements of the system to the system itself is a measure of the complexity of the system
* An important factor as we move up the levels of organization is that *the interactions between constituents are constrained in some way so as to limit the possible configurations of constituents*.
* Functionally entities that have transitory relations with one another can develop significant complexity in terms of patterns of those relations. *[[System Dynamics|Dynamic]] systems can develop cycles of interactions that recur regularly in time.*

* **Potential Complexity** - a measure of complexity which takes into account: 
	* The number of kinds of components
	* The number of kinds of possible interactions between all combinations of component types
	* The number of objects of each type of component contained within the boundary of the system. 
	* *Potential Complexity pertains to all possible ways that components can be combined together*
* **Realized Complexity** - a measure of complexity regarding how the parts are organized, connected, and function together. 
	* It is a challenge for systems science to figure out, with hindsight, the process of transforming, evolving connectivity that has brought about a realized complexity of a system
	* *Realized Complexity pertains to what would be observed due to constraints such as scarcity or geometric configuration*. 

* *Realized Complexity tends to be much smaller than Potential Complexity.*
* Potential Complexity within a layer of organization can increase or decrease with respect to the previous layer.
	* If it increases, it means that there are many ways to combine components from the previous layer. In particular, there are many interaction potentials between components with few constraints. 
	* If it decreases, it means that either:
		* There are only a few ways for the components to combine to be functional subsystems, usually indicative of additional constraints.
		* There exists [[System Control|control systems]] that manage the complexity.
