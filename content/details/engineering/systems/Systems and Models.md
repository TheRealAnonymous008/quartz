# Models of Systems 
* *From the outside, the system appears opaque* and we can only infer or speculate on how the system works through how it behaves through the use of models. 
* *From the inside, the system appears to be a part of a larger system*. An observer from inside the system must be aware that it is prone to bias, and that it is also a component of the system using its subjective abilities to observe the system 

* *Knowledge is the base of patterned expectation*. We use knowledge to assess [[Information in Systems|information]].
* *A crucial [[Feedback Loop|feedback loop]] is how information reinforces knowledge and knowledge gives more ways to interpret information*. The [[Trade Offs#Freedom of Choice Trade-Off|tradeoff between flexibility and rigidity]] exists. 

* **Concepts** are neural-based models of other systems that we observe. 
	* More complex concepts are derived and constructed from simpler concepts. Neurologically, this involves forming links between neurons. 
	* *Concepts are both abstract and real*. They are abstract because they are models, but they are also real because they are encoded in our neurons. *Concepts are systems*. 

* A **[[Pattern Structure|pattern]]** is any set of components that stand in an organized relationship with one another from one system instance to another. 
	* **Spatial patterns** exist when there is a consistent set of spatial relations between components. 
	* **Temporal patterns** exist when there is a consistent temporal relation between components. 
	* **Maps** are abstract representations that link between a pattern in one feature space to a pattern in another. 
		* Two objects mapped to each other are **isomorphic**. 
		* Maps are represented through [[Mathematics|mathematical relations]]. 
		* *Mappings are developed as one experiences associations in real life* This is the essence of learning.
	* A **property** is a feature that constitute a pattern.
	* A **characteristic** is a property of an object that is always present in that kind of object. 
		* *The properties of an object are actually based on properties of the system itself or its subsystems*
		* Properties exist in a hierarchy depending on the level of observation. 
		* Properties are measurable. *Measurement is comparing one system to another via the forces of interaction between them*. Consistency assures us that measurements remain consistent and characteristics that are observed will be consistent.
		* Measurement operates not on "exact" instantaneous metrics but on differentials. That is *we extrapolate information from measurements using differences between the compared systems.*
	* **Features** are arrangements of component parts where such arrangements have properties that can be differentiated by measuring devices
		* Features come in hierarchies. Macro-level features can usually be decomposed into micro-level features. 
	* **Classes** are groupings of features that imply a generalization. 
		* Classification of groups of objects with similar features is *a means of increasing the efficiency of mapping* and, hence, pattern recognition and selection. 
		* Classification means we are able to abstract away certain features that are shared by all objects of a particular class. 

* Patterns are sets of relations that organize the set of features at any given level in the feature hierarchy, into a map.
* *Repeated experience furnishes our fundamental means of recognizing the regularity of relationship that constitutes pattern or organization*

* One approach that is important is that of **Abstraction**. One such tool that embodies this is [[Linguistics|language]].
	* Note however, that much, perhaps even most, of the associations and concepts neurologically are not accessible as discrete concepts like nouns and verbs. 

* Because a conceptual model is in itself a system, the competency of a brain to use the conceptual model is tied to how high a concept level it can represent.
	* The conceptual model is a [[Complex Systems|complex system]]. Higher level concepts are composed of interrelated lower level concepts. Lower level concepts can be a part of multiple higher level concepts. 
	* The dynamics of this conceptual model is encompassed with a complex network between concepts -- both in the same level as well as higher and lower levels of organization.
# Systems as Models 
* Systems are [[The Psychopathology of Everyday Things|conceptual models]] for the world around us. They usually have a strong congruence with the world. However, they often fall short of [[False Priors|representing]] the world fully
	* Systems fool us by presenting themselves as a series of events.
	* We are less likely to be surprised if we see how events accumulate into dynamic patterns of behavior.
	* *Behavior based models are more useful than event based ones* because they facilitate understanding of the underlying systems and have more predictive power. However, there are a few pitfalls 
		* They overemphasize flows and underemphasize stocks. 
		* In trying to find statistical links that relate flows to each other, we are trying to find something that does not exist. 
		* The predictive power of such models are better for short-term rather than long-term performance. 

* *Systems feature non-linear relationships* These nonlinearities make systems more difficult to understand. 
	* These non-linearities can also change the relative strengths of the feedback loops. 
	* *Non-linearities can cause dominance shifts among the feedback loops of the system.*.

* *Systems rarely have boundaries*. They rarely exist within a closed system.
	* Systems as models simplify this by delineating a system in study with other systems that very likely do not influence the system in a significant way based on what is being studied.
	* In the end, there is no single legitimate boundary that can be drawn around a system. 
	* Too narrow of a boundary can lead to surprises as external variables that do influence the system are not included in the model.
	* Too large of a boundary results in complicated analyses. 
	* [[Framing Effect]] applies in this case as we may be prone to setting the boundaries based on existing boundaries.

* *In systems, many causes can produce many effects* Any physical entity with multiple inputs and outputs is surrounded by layers of limits. 
	* At any given time, the input that is most important to a system is one that is most limiting. 
	* Changes in limiting factors tend to be the most impactful. 
	* As the system evolves, the input that is limiting also changes. One factor may become limiting or non-limiting in the future. 
	* *There will always be limits to growth.* They can be self-imposed. If they aren't they will be system imposed. 

* *Systems always feature delay*. It is surprising how long things change in a system. Stocks are delays, and most flows have delays. 
	* It is important to consider the scale of the delays that are important. Consider delays at the right level of granularity. 
	* When there are long delays in feedback loops, *some sort of foresight is essential*. To act only when a problem becomes obvious is to miss an important opportunity to solve the system. 

* *Human-based systems typically feature bounded rationality*. People act in their best interests based on the information they have even if it is to society's detriment. 
	* Perfect information is rarely present in a system. 
	* We have our own share of faulty [[Human Biases|biases]] which render it difficult to act rationally. 
	* One remedy to bounded rationality is to introduce more information. 
	* The right [[Knowing What To Do -- Constraints, Discoverability and Feedback|feedback]] also helps actors behave rationally as they impose corrective behavior. Incentives and constraints also help. 

* *Our brains naturally form conceptual networks (in the form of neurons) that match conceptualized abstract [[Networks in Systems|networks]]*.
