* **Adaptive Control** involves a controller adapting to the system with parameters that may vary or are initially uncertain. 

* Most adaptive control mechanisms involve a stimulus causing the system to respond specifically to the [[Information in Systems|informational]] content of the stimulus. In particular *the stimulus-response mechanism itself is modified over time based on previously observed stimuli*

* Creating responses is in itself a response mechanism. This response construction mechanism is present in adaptive systems.

* **Anticipatory Control** necessitates creating a  [[Systems and Models|model of the system]] and formulating a response based on the information from this model.
