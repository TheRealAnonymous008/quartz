* We assume the existence of $n$ units [[Graph Theory|interconnected]] via information exchange links, represented as weighted vertices. We call the graph representing this the **information network**
* We let 
  $$
  x=\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ \vdots \\ x_n \end{bmatrix}
  $$
  is the state matrix assuming the state of unit $i$, $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^s$ is represented as a row vector.
  
  We also adopt the in-degree convention for the Laplacian
