* A **complex network** is a [[Fundamental Constructs of Graph Theory|graph]] with non-trivial features. Normally, these correspond to some patterns that are neither purely regular or purely random. 
* Much can be understood from analyzing the structure of everyday networks. Networks permeate many of our daily [[System Science|systems]] (i.e. social systems, the Internet, protein interactions, etc...).
* Understanding communities through the lens of network science provides an explanation for why "like-attracts-like" . It is interesting to see this applied in a social setting where niche communities cluster around a common interest. This appears to be ubiquitous in the modern day.
