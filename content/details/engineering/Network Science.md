* Much can be understood from analyzing the structure of everyday networks. Networks permeate many of our daily [[System Science|systems]] (i.e. social systems, the Internet, protein interactions, etc...).
* The fact that *many real networks are scale free* means most real systems have "centers of interest" (i.e., hubs).  These hubs are a double edged sword, they provide connectivity to the system, while also introducing vulnerabilities such as being superspreaders of pathogens. 
* Understanding communities through the lens of network science provides an explanation for why "like-attracts-like" . It is interesting to see this applied in a social setting where niche communities cluster around a common interest. This appears to be ubiquitous in the modern day.

* A **complex network** is a [[Fundamental Constructs in Graph Theory|graph]] with non-trivial features. Normally, these correspond to some patterns that are neither purely regular or purely random.
