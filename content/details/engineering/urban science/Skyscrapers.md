* Tall buildings let us pack more people in a smaller area of land.
# Materials
* **Steel**, in contrast to traditional stone and brick, is durable, easy to make and lightweight. 
	* Steel is an alloy that sits between wrought iron (very low carbon) and cast iron (low carbon). It inherits the malleability of wrought iron and the strength of cast iron.
* **Concrete** is a mix of cement, water and aggregate (consisting of particulates of a hard material). 
	* It is easily composed and molded to suit various construction needs. *It also becomes stronger over time via curing*
	* The most important advancement to concrete is the Portland cement.
	* It is *strong against compression* (which is good for supporting a building's weight), but it is *weak against tension*. It is usually reinforced with a steel mesh (to form **rebar**) to add tensile strength.
	* *Concrete and steel expand and contract at almost exactly the same rate when temperatures vary.*
* *Glass* is typically used as the skin of the skyscraper.
	* Large sheets of glass can be made using the *float glass method* of Alastair Pilkington.
	* Considerations for using glass in skyscrapers include making it span large distances (both lengthwise and up) with little support. *Glass does not support the building, it hangs*.
	* Other considerations involve temperature control and anti-fogging mechanisms, achieved through appropriate composition of the glass.

# Construction
* We need to support the building
	* **Dead Load** - pertains to the weight of the structure itself.
	* **Live Load** - pertains to the weight of anything inside.
	* Buildings are built using **piles** of steel beams which form the **foundation** of the building.
	* As we go higher, the steel beams at the top need to be closer together, and the base needs to be wider.
	* Using only steel foundation is not enough for buildings that are $>40$ storeys. This would require specialized structures instead.
* We need to transport the materials.
	* Cranes could be used, however, they cannot extend very high. Instead, we use *growing cranes* that are built alongside the building/
	* For efficiency, we can consider *modular designs*.
* We need to account for the people.
	* *Elevators are crucial for skyscrapers* as they are what make tall buildings feasible to use. We can either use hydraulics or cable.
	* We can speed up the elevator travel time either by using better elevator algorithms or increasing the speed of the elevator itself.
* *We need to account for swaying*.
	* We need to prevent the building from swaying because of wind (via **vortex shedding**) or seismic activity that matches its **resonant frequency**.
	* The taller we go, the more we have to worry about the wind speed and pressure (which scales quadratically with wind speed.)
	* The trick for vortices is to prevent them from forming in the first place. Another way is to use a **tuned mass damper** to counteract the force.
	* Revolving doors are there to prevent the air from being sucked into or pushed out of the building. *Revolving doors are always closed*. This also saves energy and controls wind flowing into and out of the building.
# The Future
* Substitutes for cement which are environmentally friendly
* Use of glass for natural lighting and temperature control to save energy. 
* Glass that is self-cleaning.
* Electrochromic smart glass that changes the appearance of the glass.
* [[Additive Manufacturing|3D printing]] of building components
* The greenification of buildings. Vertical Gardens that are designed with their plant's needs in mind.
* Air quality control -- minimizing pollutants.
* Ergonomic design.
* Energy Harvesting -- incorporating methods of collecting energy within the skyscraper itself.
