# Electricity
* Electricity provided a way to pipe energy around. They are one key factor that allowed the modern city to thrive.
* *The real cost of electricity (for cities) comes in generating it* from other sources of electricity (coal, hydropower, etc...)
	* In principle, all forms of electricity generation rely on Induction -- move a wire through a magnet.
* We need transformers to control the amount of electricity each area in the city receives. *Transformers manage the supply of electricity*.
	* The transformers form a part of the **Electricity Grid**. 
		* At the local level, transformers are connected via substations via **distribution lines**
		* At a larger level, distribution lines are connected to energy sources via **transmission lines**, usually characterized with thicker electric cables.
# Heat
* The alternative to electricity is *natural gas* which are pumped to buildings to be *used in heating systems*.
	* An alternative is **district energy** which relies on pumping water from heavily insulated pipes. The water is independent from the city's water supply and can use wasted heat energy from generators.
# Wind
* [[Winds and Atmospheric Kinetics|Wind]] turbines are tall because they capture the highest speed wind possible. 
* The amount of energy captured from the wind is proportional to the speed of the wind that turns the turbine.
* Wind turbines have aerofoil-shaped blades to cut through the wind easily, allowing it to spin more easily and to spin the loops of wire in the generator.
* Longer blades = more wind that can be harvested.
* Something to consider is the composition of the blade since they can bend after repeated use.
* Another thing is the [[Weather Systems|weather]] -- they are dependent on the presence of wind.

# Solar
* Getting energy from [[The Earth and Insolation|the sun]] via solar panels which consist of photovoltaic cells.
* We tend to use a sandwich of silicon
	* A bottom layer that is positive (**p-type**)
	* A filling that is negative (**n-type**)
	* A layer of anti-reflective glass to prevent light from being reflected (and hence not harvested).
* Solar panels work effectively by a chain of electrons -- photons excite the filling which pushes an electron to the bottom layer and so on.
* We need to consider the angle the solar panel faces the sun. 

# General Considerations
* Cities are the dominant force behind economic growth. Electricity improves productivity.
* We are looking more towards renewable energy.
* More population means more demand for electricity.

* Better grid design.
* Use of a smart grid system to monitor varying energy supply and demand.
* Distributed generation -- households having storage systems or generators on site.
* Use of mini-grids.
* Combined Heat, Power, and Cooling System -- using hot water from the generator for the building.
* Electric vehicles and how to account for them.
* Use of trees and greenery to make cities cooler and mitigate the urban heat island effect.
* Improving existing renewable energy methods.
* Energy storage methods
* Better and longer-lasting batteries.
