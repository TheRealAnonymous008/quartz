* **Factory Physics** is the study of the underlying behavior of manufacturing [[System Science|systems]]. It allows us to identify optimizations, design new systems, and balance tradeoffs to coordinate policies from disparate areas.
	* Low-level operations details have always had strategic consequences for manufacturing firms.
	* The answer to the problem of operations management is *not what to do about manufacturing problems, but how to [[System Opportunities|think]] about them*
	* Factory physics is founded on -- Problem solving, Technical details, and Well-developed intuition about the manufacturing processes.
	* We make use of [[Data Analytics|prescriptive models]]  based on provided assumptions. In this sense, *all laws in Factory Physics are tautologies*. These assumptions, however, can be validated with empirical evidence.

* Factory Physics is a [[Science|scientific approach]].
	* The scientific approach gives a set of tools for understanding the system.
	* Science offers precision using the language of [[Mathematics]].
	* Science offers intuition about the world around us.
	* Science facilitates synthesis of disparate perspectives.
