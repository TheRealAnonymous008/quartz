* The main KPI's of manufacturing are Quality, Rate (i.e., throughput), Cost, and Flexibility (how easy it is to implement changes)
* The aim of manufacturing is to optimize the productive time of the entire assembly line 
  
  $$
  \begin{split}
  \text{Availability} &= \frac{\text{Total Hours Planned} - \text{Lost Time}}{\text{Total Hours Planned}} \\
  
  
  \text{Performance Rate} &= \frac{\text{Actual Machine Speed}}{\text{Design Machine Speed}} \\
  
  \text{Quality Rate} &= \frac{\text{Number of Good Products}}{\text{Products Made}}
  \end{split}

	* *Downtimes are costly because it costs money*

* Many jobs normally thought of as being in the service sector depend on manufacturing for their existence. Thus, moving manufacturing abroad has a huge [[Economics|economic]] impact. 

* **Operations** refer to the application of resources for the production of goods
* There are three important dimensions to consider
	* **Cost**. From the production side, the [[Firms, Production and Externalities|amount of capital and labor]]. From the consumer side, the unit cost (total cost divided by total volume). *Manufacturers of commodities try to minimize cost*
	* **Quality**. From the consumer side, we have external quality. From the production side, internal quality. *Manufacturers of premium or luxury goods rely on quality of the product*
	* **Speed**. The goal is to bring products to the market as swiftly as possible. *Manufacturers of technology-dependent products rely on speed*

* Manufacturing environments vary greatly with respect to their process structure -- the manner in which material moves through the plant *The decision of what process structure to use depends on expected [[Scarcity, Supply, and Demand|demand]] and volume*
	* **Job Shops** - Small lots are produced with a high variety of routings through the plant. Flow through the plant is jumbled, setups are common. This setup allows for more customizability and is *more suited for products with high customizability, low volumes, and slower rates.*
	* **Disconnected Flow Lines** - Product batches are produced on a limited number of identifiable routings (i.e., paths through the plant). Although routings are distinct, individual stations within lines are not connected by a paced material handling system, so that inventories can build up between stations. *Used to make similar items on a repeat basis, where the volumes are not high enough to allow for a connected line flow*
	* **Connected Flow Lines**  - The classic Assembly line. Product is fabricated and assembled along a rigid routing connected by a paced material handling system. *Suited for a narrow product range where production can be automated to produce high volumes of standardized at a faster rate*
	* **Continuous Flow Processes**  flows automatically down a fixed routing, no longer divided into discrete units. *Suited for very high volume, commodity products*. 

* In a **push production control system**, work releases are scheduled in advance based on customer due dates, but must respond to changes in the plant
	* Production is triggered by a schedule
	* As soon as work on a part is complete at a workstation, it is "pushed" to the next workstation. 
	* All machines work as long as they have the parts.
* In a **pull production control system**, work releases are authorized based on changes in the plant, but must be adjusted for customer due date.
	* Production is triggered by demand.
	* An operator requires both parts and an authorization signal to work
