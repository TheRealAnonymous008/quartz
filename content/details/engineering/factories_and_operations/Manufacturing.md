* The primary goal of manufacturing products is to make money for the business. However, there are various metrics that give indicators for factory performance. 
* The main KPI's of manufacturing are Quality, Rate (i.e., throughput), Cost, and Flexibility (how easy it is to implement changes). *The exact definitions for 
  "performance" that go beyond their formal definitions will depend on the needs of the business*
* The aim of manufacturing is to optimize the productive time of the entire assembly line 
  
  $$
  \begin{split}
  \text{Availability} &= \frac{\text{Total Hours Planned} - \text{Lost Time}}{\text{Total Hours Planned}} \\
  
  
  \text{Performance Rate} &= \frac{\text{Actual Machine Speed}}{\text{Design Machine Speed}} \\
  
  \text{Quality Rate} &= \frac{\text{Number of Good Products}}{\text{Products Made}}
  \end{split}

	* *Downtimes are costly because it costs money*

* Many jobs normally thought of as being in the service sector depend on manufacturing for their existence. Thus, moving manufacturing abroad has a huge [[Economics|economic]] impact. 

* **Operations** refer to the application of resources for the production of goods
* There are three important dimensions to consider
	* **Cost**. From the production side, the [[Firms, Production and Externalities|amount of capital and labor]]. From the consumer side, the unit cost (total cost divided by total volume). *Manufacturers of commodities try to minimize cost*
	* **Quality**. From the consumer side, we have external quality. From the production side, internal quality. *Manufacturers of premium or luxury goods rely on quality of the product*
	* **Speed**. The goal is to bring products to the market as swiftly as possible. *Manufacturers of technology-dependent products rely on speed*
