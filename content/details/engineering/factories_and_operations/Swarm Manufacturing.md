* Unlike other manufacturing frameworks, swarm manufacturing aims to decentralize and generalize to the production of multiple products by having the factory consist of a swarm of mobile manufacturing [[Robotics|robots]] that can recalibrate themselves in real time.

# C3DP
* Cooperative 3D Printing is a task involving printing an object using a swarm of machines with 3D printers. The goal is to reduce print time and increase print scale without needing to increase printer size or reduce print resolution.

* [^poudel_2022] proposes an architecture for the cooperative 3D printing (C3DP) task. It outlines the hardware and software architecture of the system.
