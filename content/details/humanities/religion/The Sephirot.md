* Derives from the Zohar. It aims to transform the biblical narrative into a biography of God. *The Sephirot describe the nature of God. The individual aspects of God that come together to form the whole-- Infinite*.
* The upper Sephirot require the lower Sephirot. The lower Sephirot require the upper. *The Sephirot act in unison (oneness)*. 
# The Tree Of Life (Otz Chiim)
* The Classical Arrangement in Qabalah for the Sephirot. It consists of the Sephirot laid out as ten spheres with 22 paths interconnecting them (each path has a corresponding Hebrew [[Creation (Kabbalah)#The Creation of the World|letters]]). 
	* It lays out the structure by which the Sephirot emanated from one another.
* The Tree of Life is to be interpreted as an abstraction for cosmic principles found in myth, as well as the character of the soul of man. In this sense, *The Tree of Life links the microcosm of Man with the macrocosm of the Divine*.
* It shows the concept of the *trinity* - Being, Non-Being, and Coming into Being; Thesis, Antithesis, Synthesis. 
* The tree consists of tree pillars
	* The **Pillar of Severity** - The Left Pillar. associated with black, and the analytic, repulsive, feminine, and disintegrating principles of the Universe.
		* Associated with the **Hermetic Path** or analytic path towards Enlightenment.
		* Said to be the origin of the [[The Qliphoth|Qliphoth]] and dark forces because of its principle for Separation. It reflects how [[Religion and Mysticism|Knowledge can be dangerous]]
	* The **Pillar of Mercy** - The Right Pillar. associated with white, and the connective, attractive, masculine, and associative principles of the Universe.
		* Associated with the **Orphic Path** or artistic path towards Enlightenment
	* The **Pillar of Mildness** - The Middle Pillar. associated with gold which balances the other two pillars.
		* Associated with the **Royal Path** or the path which balances between the extremes of the other pillars.
* Some postulate the Tree as being of the same root as the Tree of Knowledge.

* A general aspect of the Tree in terms of positives and negatives is as follows:
	* Those on the Pillar of Severity are negative. Those on the Pillar of Mercy are positive. Those on the Pillar of mildness are both.
	* Each Sephirah is negative in relation to those above it, and positive in relation to those below it (i.e., Chesed is negative in relation to Chokmah).
# Atziluth
* There is a polarity between Chokmah and Binah. Both are opposites yet both contribute to Being. In practical terms, they correspond to the balance between activity and passivity found in the Natural Order of things. *Polarity drives equilibrium*.
* Because Keter constantly manifests the unmanifested, the Supernal Triangle of Keter, Chokmah, and Binah is never in equilibrium. *The Universe Cycles between being dominated by Chokmah and by Binah. This is the natural order of things.*
* *Chokmah and Binah are the essential Maleness and Femaleness in their creative aspects* -- \With no Form, the energy simply radiates into space. With no Force, there is no action.

## Keter (Crown) 
* *Associated Color*: Pure White

### Characterization
* The first sephirah. It shares in the negative nature of Ein Sof. 
* It is nothingness, but one degree from non-existence. God *undifferentiated. unified, formless, and passive*. It is the first being that has individual existence. the first step from infinite to finite.
	* It exists yet does not conform to a human's criteria of existence -- having form and activity. 
	* *To reach Keter is to reach Annihilation*. 
* It is the crown on the head of Adam Qadmon (Primordial Adam). Thus, Keter is the root of roots--the image of God that man is made from.
	* The root of man is nothingness. Ergo, reaching Keter implies the annihilation of thought. Ego death.
	* Because it is the crown and not the head, it symbolizes how the innermost spiritual essence is never in actual manifestation, but is always the underlying basis whence all springs. *Manifestation emanates from essence, from Keter.*.
	* Spirit flows out into manifestation in matter, but matter by its own energy draws spirit into manifestation
* From Keter, the rest of emanation is drawn forth.

* With Chokmah, she conceives the other Sephirot. *It is the form-giving structure* that cultivates the force from Chokmah.

	* It is also associated with Time -- both giver of life and death

* *Associated Vice*:  
	* Pride -- reluctance to let go for the sake of transcendence.
	* Apathy -- detachment without vitality. All things are equally important and unimportant.

* Sometimes regarded as the union of all the Sephirot. It is where all the Sephirot exist in union.
* Also regarded as the image of God. It is the reflection of Keter. Alternatively, it may be viewed as the union between Binah and Chokmah (Primordial Mother and Father).
* After the mythical Fall, an Abyss cracks open and the divine level of Atziluth is isolated from the rest of the realms. Da'at acts as the bridge across the Abyss.
	* Some refer to this abyss as **Masak Mavidil** -- a site for banished failures such as the **Mesukiel** who "conceal god", and the site for hell.
* It is the practical synthesis between Chokmah and Binah. Prior to the fall, it was united to the other Sephirot, and gives light to the Upper Sephirot.

# Briah
* There is a balance between Chesed and Geburah.
	* Chesed includes Geburah within itself to execute judgment tinged with love. Without Geburah, it would make all things undifferentiated without identity.
	* Geburah balances with Chesed as without mercy, all things would be disintegrated. There is a point when mercy is simply weakness or even danger.
	* Chesed is Civilization and Idealism to Geburah's Nature and Realism. As with Atziluth, they exist in a rhythmic cycle with one another. Sometimes the correct response is Mercy. Sometimes, Severity.
* The trio of Chesed, Geburah, and Tiphereth represent man's Higher Soul -- his Superego or God's voice speaking to him. Experiences here are not sensed but felt emotionally. Naturally, these experiences require a greater form of concentration to attain.

### Characterization
* Pertaining to God's strict judgment and limitation. It corresponds to Justice and Power--the lash through which humanity is disciplined.
	* Wealth emanates from here through Binah. It is the way in which God answers prayers. It is also from Binah that it actualizes Death through Destruction --- destroying forms through force.
	* It also *inspires awe and fear of the Lord* -- the beginning of Wisdom and respect. This inspires us to act morally as we know justice will be served.
	* It also emphasizes *sacrifice* -- the deliberate choice of a greater good in preference to a lesser good.

* It correspond to the *principle of law, separation, discipline, and severity*. It disintegrates and creates distance to enable individual existence.

	* It is a reminder of *the need for Spiritual Nourishment* which can be obtained by being One with Nature--by treating Nature with Dignity. 

* It serves as *the equilibrium point* between the physical and the transcendental. Those below it represent the personality of the self. Those above it represent the Individuality or Higher Self.
	* The concepts embodied in the Higher Sephirot begin to concretize through Tiphereth. *As above, So below*.
	* It serves as a threshold for *Illumination of the mind to higher modes of consciousness.* It is God made manifest in the Spirit of the Mind.

* It may be seen as a symbol of the savior figure (i.e. Jesus). It is in Tiphereth where God manifests in form as the Messiah and the Redeemer.
	* It represents *sacrifice* -- the translation of Force from one Form to Another. That which is sacrificed takes up a new Form.

### Values
* *Associated Virtue*: Devotion -- the love of something higher than ourselves, evoking our ideals and the way we become like these ideals. It is to the point where we Adore the Great Work.
* *Associated Vice*: Pride --  to extend the boundaries of the soul to possess all things, rather than to give and take. To delude ourselves into thinking we are superhuman by virtue of being enlightened.

	* Here, the abstract sensations in Tiphereth slowly become concrete in the mind through imagery through the human mind. *The beings of Netzach are the embodiment of ideas*.
	* We also see here that all things men worship, especially those that cannot be explained, are grounded on real natural forces, *resolved in the mind through symbolic imagery*.
		* Here, *the fundamental Forces are perceived through contemplations of faith, and artistic expression*

* Netzach stimulates desire within the human soul, which derives from its needs -- in particular its needs for intimacy and relationships with others.
	* Here we form an image of ourselves as part of a greater whole.

### Values
* *Associated Virtue*: Unselfishness -- to go beyond immediate gratification of one desires out of regard for others. To see that there is no such thing as Good and Evil, only the balance between extremes.
* *Associated Vice*: Lust - to see desires as merely sensations and pleasures. Unstable passion that is not rooted in spiritual principle.

	* Through the human mind and concentrated will, the creative and imaginative forces of Netzach are actualized and given concrete form -- from unrestricted spiritual force to directed astral form.

* It is also associated with ceremonial magic and occult knowledge as the magician works with astral forms.

### Values
* *Associated Virtue*: Truthfulness -- to not deny the truth of our experiences, both physical and spiritual
* *Associated Vice*: Dishonesty -- to lie to ourselves, especially to save our ego. To use the mind to actualize sensations not in line with our authentic feelings.

## Yesod (Foundation) 
* *Associated Color*: Violet / Purple
* *Embodied By:* Joseph

### Characterization
* The phallus. *The procreative life force* of the Universe that serves as the foundation of the world. At the same time, it is fluid-- it is where the *Ether* resides.
	* Ether is the intermediary between the spiritual and the material. It is where the spirit operates to manifest something in the material world. It is what binds the material together
	* Yesod is symbolized by the Moon -- *the Etheric double* of the Earth -- the material.

* *The power of the preceding Sephirot are purified in Yesod and channeled to Malkuth.*
	* It is the first sphere by which man rises from a materialistic viewpoint of the world. We see beyond the material to the idealistic.
	* Yesod also acts to harmonize Hod and Netzach.

* Human righteous action stimulates Yesod and brings about divine marriage.
	* Human marriage mimics divine marriage. Its purpose is union--to give birth--to learn--to grasp the divine--to maintain the endurance of he one who apprehends with the joy of apprehending.

### Values
* *Associated Virtue*: Independence -- we escape from deterministic materialism. We create a world in which we may enforce any rule we wish-- immaterial thought becomes material thought.
* *Associated Vice*: Idleness -- being too detached from the physical world that we fail to take action.

# Asiyah
## Malkuth (Kingdom)
* *Associated Color*: Black with Citrine
* *Embodied by*: David

### Characterization
* Malkuth provides the Sephirot a channel to emanate to the lower world. 
	* Malkuth is the end result of all operations, where *all things have been manifested into a permanent material form.* Physical interacts with physical in this sphere.
	* Whatever has been built in Yesod is embodied in Malkuth through the medium of living substances -- organized form (i.e., including minerals and inorganic objects).

* It corresponds to the world of man, where he is before he begins a spiritual journey. *The Spiritual Journey starts with mastering Matter*.
	* Unless the feet of Divine Man is not planted on the Earth, no stability is possible.
	* We need to cast out the illusory from the real through an empirical means.

* To rise above Malkuth, we must learn to sacrifice the lesser to the greater. To do this requires the ability to *discern the differences between things*.

### Values
* *Associated Virtue*: Discrimination -- to cast out what is [[The Qliphoth|undesirable]], and to preserve the good to maintain stability.
* *Associated Vice*: 
	* Avarice - to accept what is undesirable and discard what is good. To be unwilling to sacrifice.
	* Inertia - being impatient in reaching spiritual enlightenment without being stable leads to going nowhere. Equally, too much stability leads nowhere but materialism.

* The Feminine half of God.  Described as God's bride.
* The Union of Tif'eret and Shekhinah gives birth to the human soul, and thus derives the spiritual quest of Man.
	* By knowing and withstanding the dark underside of wisdom, the spiritual seeker is refined.
