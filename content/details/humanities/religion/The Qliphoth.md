* The counterpoint of the Sephirot.  Qliphoth means "**shell**".  They are the reverse side of the Sephirot that occur due to imbalance or deficiency.
* The Qliphoth is ruled by the primordial couple Samael and Lilith.
* Some views on the Qliphoth
	* As the last link on the chain of emanation -- the furthest away from God's absolute good.
	* Shells that protect the world from pure evil, even though they also separate God from man.
	* Waste products expelled from the process of [[Creation (Kabbalah)|creation]].
	* Rooted in primordial dark worlds that are as old as God himself, if not older.
# Enumeration of Qlipha
* Every Qlipha represents a negative aspect of each Sefira, ruled by demons rather than angels:

* An alternative is presented as follows. See Les Mysteres de la Kabbale by Eliphas Levi

| Sephiroth | Qliphoth demigod / Demon counterpart | Characterization |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Keter | Lucifer | Ruled by The inverted pentagram, **Remfam**, despotism| 
| Chokmah | Nibbas / Samaxia and Belial | Blind Faith, Black Magic and Clerical Science
| Binah | Tharac / Astaroth | Unlimited Stupidity | 
| Chesed | Azima / Belphegor and demon goat Mendez | Obscure and Carnal love
| Geburah | Marcolis / Moloch | Inflexible rigidity and determinism
| Tiphereth | Anamelech / Pegasus | The Beast triumphs.
| Netzach | Nergal / Abraxas and Mars | Foolish Pride
| Hod | Succoth Benoth | Lethal Motherliness
| Yesod | Nisroch | Impure Phallus
| Malkuth | Adramelek | The world of pride | 
### Kellipath Nogah (Brillaint Shell)
* The sphere in which good and evil are mixed. Thus, he has the possibility for either good or evil.
* [[The Sephirot#Shekhinah (Presence)|Shekhinah]] is given importance here as it embodies the duality of man--with the presence of God, man has the potential to be good. Otherwise, man falls to evil.
* According to Luria, it is the source of man's lower soul. 
# Qliphotic Path
* **Sitra Ahra** (The Other Side) is the world of the Qliphoth -- *the world of Evil* that constantly attempts to break into the Holy Side and win over the world of man through temptation.
* Lilith is viewed as the female personification of this domain. It embodies sin and lawlessness.
* The darkness of Sitra Ahra is viewed as something primeval, which is a common theme in mythology -- that Evil comes before Good.
	* Postulated as existing because of Geburah and punishing man during the fall. Related to this is its potential role as a *purifying purgatory*.
	* Another theory is it exists and thrives because of the sinfulness of Man.
	* The Sitra Ahra may also be viewed as the *shells that contain the sparks*. Without man, it is just a negation of good, but man can bring life to the Sitra Ahra and actualize its evil.
		* The Shekinah may be likened to a divine spark imprisoned in the Sitra Ahra. The Messiah will enter and bring it back, thus annihilating evil.
		* Related to this is the possibility the Sitra Ahra would perish without the sparks inside it that bring it to life.
		* Another possibility is that the sparks were what was good in evil, and would enable evil to reach salvation.

* To enter this realm, man requires an **esoteric initiation** to lay bare the occult hiding behind outer phenomena. This *allows access to hidden truths* and unlocks the power of [[Good and Evil (Kabbalah)|creation]]). 
	* *It symbolizes the death of the novice and the birth of a new man. A descent to the underworld, rebirth, and ascent*.
	* This gives access to three levels of knowledge: 
		* **Exoteric knowledge** - mundane and common [[Science]].
		* **Light esoteric knowledge** -- the light tradition. Towards divine unity with God.
		* **Dark esoteric knowledge** - the dark tradition. Going beyond the divine.
### Initiation
* Entering the Qliphotic path has four phases (related to alchemy).
	* **Nigredo** - the material level / Asiyah 
	* **Albedo** - the astral plane / Yetzirah
	* **Citrinitas** - the mental level. / Briah
	* **Rubedo** - the divine final goal. / Atziluth
* It may also be divided into seven stages based on alchemic processes. It has 11 steps reflecting man's journey going beyond divinity. [^2]

# The Orders of Qliphoth [^3]
## Nahemo / Lilith
* *Ruler*: Nahema (Lilith's sister)
* Worshipped by the: Amalekites (attackers),  Geburims (violent),  Raphaim (cowards),  Nephilim (depraved),  Anakims (anarchists)
* Accessed via Lilith.
	* The Mother of Demons, Queen of Vampires, Ruler of Harlots, and the Empress of Evil. The Moon that radiated from its own force and refused to yield to the Sun.
	* The *Soul of Wild Animals*; Mother Earth in her more violent aspects, corresponding to the wild and carnal which refuses to yield to Man.
* Through Lilith we enter the Qliphoth. One may *access Lilith through dreams and unconsciousness*, as that is what she is associated with. The Unconscious contains our repressed desires and fears.
## Gamaliel
* *Ruler*: Lilith
* The *shadow of anima mundi* -- the world soul. Lilith exerts her influence here still.
* It is the *Qlipha of Dark dreams*. Gamaliel contains the dreams that man normally cannot or does not wish to remember or refuses to accept.
	* It is the sphere of forbidden sexuality--going beyond seduction but towards a higher state of mind..
	* Also associated with blood since it corresponds to fertility (menstruation), life and death.
	* The gods of witches belong here. Those that correspond to *life and death; blood and sexuality*.
## Samael
* *Ruler*: Adrammelek
* The great tempter. *He who tempts with knowledge (similar to the Serpent)*, particularly occult wisdom. The blasphemer that destroys illusion with intellect. 
	* It is the dark intellect that is perceived as Madness.
	* Samael poisons the moral rules and replaces them with aesthetic rules that let us see the beauty of things through artistic creation.
	* The trickster gods belong here--the gods that are wise and cunning.
* Here: *Insanity becomes Wisdom* and we recreate old values starting by deconstructing values to see the world through new perspectives.

## A'Arab Zaraq / Hereb Serapel
* *Ruler*: Baal
* *Represents battle*. Invoked to achieve victory in the battle of life.
	* The war gods belong here.
* *Symbolized by the Raven* which represents war and storm, but also passion, sin and forbidden wisdom. It lives off the dead and is the free spirit of death.
	* The Raven corresponds to flying in ecstasy after meeting life and death. *It is to overcome the fear of death and to learn how to live through a black baptism*.
	* Here is the sphere of dark emotions -- forbidden feelings, obscure instincts, explosive creative expressions.
		* Thus, here reside the Nephilim who were born from the meeting of heaven and earth.

## Thagirion / Tagaririm
* *Ruler*: Belphegor
* *Represents dispute and juridical process*. Interpreted as similar to how Satan acts as the prosecutor on God's behalf, as well as the place where God's judgment is located.
* Corresponds to the child or offspring -- to the Anti-Messianic characters, in contrast to Tiphereth's Messiah. Both are associated with the Sun and solar gods.
	* *Man can save himself*. Man does not need God to save himself.
	* This level also means illumination via a Daemon that acts as a guide. Here, man becomes one with the ideals they strive for--either through a feeling of total power, or total benevolence. *Man experiences his Complete Self*.

## Golachab / Galab
* *Ruler*: Asmodeus
* Associated with fire. It contains the Arsonists, the Spirits of Wrath, those who burn with Fire. It is characterized by *mercilessness, violence and suffering, revolution and rebellion.*.

* Here, lust and suffering pass over each other in ecstatic energy. Thanatos becomes Eros. 

## The Abyss / Masak Mavdil
* From the perspective of the light side, it is where one falls down after failing to achieve the divine.
* From the perspective of the dark side, it is the river that separates  the darkest center of the underworld from its surrounding parts
* Passing through here means Death.

## Satariel
* *Ruler*: Lucifuge.
* Characterized by *Absurdity and Mystery* - the answers within but lie hidden under darkness.
	* Associated with gods of Fate, Destiny, and Time.
	* Here we grope in the darkness until we attain clear sight via a third eye.

## Ghagiel / Chaigidel
* *Ruler*: Beelzebub

# The Tree of Evil
* The side pillars of the Tree of Evil correspond to Compulsion, Coercion, and Condemnation -- counteracting Severity, Mercy, and Moderation respectively in [[The Sephirot#The Tree Of Life (Otz Chiim)|The Tree of Life]].
	* If Man's true nature is inherently Good, then the only ways to condemn him is through coercion or compulsion.
	* Condemnation drives us towards eventual extinction. *Evil is not sustainable long-term*.
	* *Coercion acts on Pleasure.. Compulsion acts on Pain*.
* The Tree of Evil is *what would happen if we deliberately rejected the qualities of the Tree of life*.

## Materialism (Qimranut)
* *Life is confined to physical levels applying to humans for one incarnation only, during which they should get all they can out of it.*
* It is the refusal to recognize any kind of living away from this world. 
* They offer no opposition to intended Evil or opportunity for intended Good. They allow for spiritual damnation because they do not believe these have reality.
* If it is beneficial physically, then it must be good. There is no Principle of Evil.

1. Life is here for me to experience.
2. Matter is everything.
3. I live as an evolved animal.
4. I will only have this one Earth life to become myself.
5. I ought to get all I can
6. The existence of Spirit is impossible. 
7. I will relate all on Earth by the common denominator of money. As I control that, so shall I do what I want in this world.
8. Without an earthly body, I cannot live.
9. I cannot believe in anything excepting this physical world.
10. Eat, Drink, and be Merry, for tomorrow we die.

## Instability (Aiyatsbus)
* *It is spiritual weakness which results in humans not making much sense. It is to lose faith in Life.*
* It is here we find confusion, weakness, distortion of vision, and insanity that misdirects people on the path of enlightenment.

1. Life is a matter of chance.
2. Life is instability.

4. Place faith in nothing.

1. You cannot make Life pay without cheating.
2. Be known by your self-importance.
3. Take every advantage of others for your own benefit.

## Ugliness (Kaitul)
* *To create a controllable chaos which affects others yet leaves one's main interests clear. To make ourselves worse on purpose to avoid perfection*.
* It implies the denial or denigration of the Divinity of Man through attempts to make Life seem horrible and wretched.
* It is rooted in a refusal to live by the rules of Cosmic harmony. The deadly type of Ugliness is that which we accept on purpose to screen our somewhat hideous states of unsatisfactory Selfhood from the Blessed Beauty which would show this up too clearly.

9. Subdue by ferocious force.
10. Make others accept your discipline.

* *To be indifferent, lazy, and have a bored outlook on Life -- to let Life go to hell*.

* It is a strong person's failing towards feebler creatures by not providing assistance in the path of perfection.

10. It is all past comprehension.

## Stupidity (Iweleth)
* *A positive refusal to become Wise, normally through sheer inertia. To stay in the comforts of ignorance with the rest of the crowd.*.
* It is the closing of a soul against its divine destiny.

1. Where ignorance is bliss 'tis folly to be wise.
2. Why be wise when stupidity is acceptable?
3. Who fears the wisdom of any God?
4. Obscure the clarity of wisdom.
5. Why work at wisdom when foolishness gives pleasure.

10. Better luxuriously stupid than penuriously wise.

## Atheism (Bacikal)
* *To deny the existence of a Supreme Spirit that gives life its essence. To live life without reference to it.*.

* It distracts Mankind from its main mission of seeking Self-salvation.

1. God is dead, not living.
2. No God. Do what you will.
3. Wherever is God?
4. God is nothing.
5. God is nothing but impossible.
