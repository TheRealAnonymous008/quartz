# Three Veils of Existence
## Ayin (Nothingness)
* More existent than all the being of the world. But since it is simple, and every simple thing is complex compared with its simplicity
* No one can understand anything about it. It is negated of every conception. No one can know anything about it—except the belief that it exists. Its existence cannot be grasped by anyone other than it. 
* Therefore its name is “*I am becoming*.” It exists according to its own idea of existence.
* *Being joins with Nothingness* in the nexus of infinity. This is where we apply our faith towards. 
* No vessel can contain God, unless it is Ayin.

## Ein Sof (Infinity)
* Genesis alludes to a primal beginning via the emanation of God and the [[The Sephirot|sefirot]] from **Ein Sof** (lit. Endless). Ein Sof represents the radical transcendence of God from negations. *It is God prior to manifestation*.
	* Although the sefirot emanate from Ein Sof, they are merely different aspects of it. If Ein Sof is white light, the sefirot are the individual colors as it passes through tinted glass.
* Ein Sof cannot neither be conceived nor expressed, for these would imply differentiation. It cannot be known because it is hidden in the mystery of absolute nothingness. *It is a place pertaining to Oblivion*
### Metaphysics
* The nature of God is Oneness -- being everything. He is *Nothing that Exists*. 
	* Divine Existence is indivisible. Everything is linked with everything else.
* *God is not dual. All existence is God. Nothing is devoid of God's divinity.*.
	* God made everything and is within everything.
	* Thus, humans have divinity within them, for they, like God also emanate from Ein Sof.
* *God enlivens everything. God's presence fills the entire world*.
	* Divinity flows in each thing. Without God, all existence would be nullified for all is one.
* The nature of existence -- *Ein Soft is independent of existence. Nullifying existence does not nullify Ein Sof.*
### Emanation
* Prior to emanation, all the sefirot were one with Ein Sof.
* After which, Ein Sof emanated one point called Keter ,and from there all the other sefirot emerged.
* All the sefirot need the power of Ein Sof, but Ein Sof does not need the power of the sefirot.

## Ohr Ein Sof (The Boundless Light)
* The Light is the divine emanations from Ein Sof, from God.

# The Creation of the World
* According to Luria, Ein Sof withdrew (**tsimtsum**) its presence from itself to itself, away from one point at the center of Infinity which served as the site of creation. *It made room for God*.  However, aspects of this were shattered into 288 sparks of light (**shevirah**) as the light of Ein Sof caused the vessels gathering it to break, and causing pure to mix with unpure. The role of humans is to mend it through holy acts (**tiqqun**).
	* Shevirah is said to be what gives the emanation the ability to be perfect. They cannot become perfect if they maintain their original form. *Creation is in the process of constant renewal*. 
	* The process of tsimtsum was governed by [[The Sephirot|Geburah]] as it required demarcation. Thus, Creation required evil to exist and not return to Unity.

> A perfect world cannot  be created, for it would then be identical to God Himself, who cannot duplicate Himself, but only restrict Himself. [^5]

[^5]: [[Qabalah, Qliphoth and Goetic Magic by Karlsson|Karlsson p. 63]]

> In the bliss of contemplating the righteous, of imagining holy people—in this fluctuation, the power to create was born.  [^3] 

[^3]: [[The Essential Kabbalah by Matt|Matt]], Creative Arousal.

* Another proposed reason for creating the Universe is that Ein Sof wished to reach awareness of itself, which can only be done through shevirah.
* The Sefirot gave rice to ten numbers (see [[Sepher Yetzirah|Sepher Yetzrah Ch. 1]])
	1) The *Spirit* of God of the Living (i.e., the Holy Spirit)
	2) From the Spirit, He produced *Air* and formed in it twenty-two sounds (Hebrew)
	3) From the Air, the *Waters* and the Surfaces.
	4) From Water, *Fire* and a Throne of Glory with the angels.
	5) *Height* (sealed with I H V)
	6) *Depth* (sealed with I V H)
	7) *East* (sealed with H I V)
	8) *West* (sealed with H V I)
	9) *South* (sealed with V I H)
	10) *North* (sealed with V H I)

* Hebrew is derived from Spirit. Three mothers, Seven doubles, and Twelve Simples: [^1] [^2]
	* The Mothers are:
		* *Aleph* - Air / Equilibrium  -  Abundance
		* *Mem*  - Water / Silent - Cold
		* *Shin* - Fire / [[Phonetics|Sibilant]]. - Heat
	* The Doubles (which have two sounds) are: 
		* *Beth* - Wisdom  - Life / Death
		* *Gimel* - Health  - War / Peace
		* *Daleth* - Fertility  - Wisdom / Folly
		* *Kaph* - Life  - Wealth / Poverty
		* *Peh* - Power  - Beauty / Ugliness
		* *Resh* - Peace  - Fertility / Barrenness
		* *Tau* - Beauty  - Power / Slavery
		* They were allotted a direction (Above, Below, East, South, West, North)
		* From these derive the Planets (Moon, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Saturn, Jupiter), the Days of the Week, and the Gates of the Soul (two eyes, two ears, the mouth, two nostrils). 
	* The Simples are
		* *Heh* - Speech  - Seeing
		* *Vau* - Thought - Hearing
		* *Zain* - Movement - Air
		* *Cheth* - Sight - Speech
		* *Teth* - Hearing - Taste
		* *Yod* -  Work - Sexual Intercourse
		* *Lamed* - Sexual Desire - Work
		* *Nun* - Smell - Movement
		* *Samech* - Sleep - Anger
		* *Oin* - Anger - Joy
		* *Tzaddi* - Taste - Thought
		* *Qoph* - Joy - Sleep
		* These were allotted a direction (North/South-East/West, and North/South/East/West-Above/Below).
		* They formed the 12 celestial constellations of the Zodiac. The 12 months of the year and the 12 organs (two hands, two feet, two kidneys, spleen, liver, gall, genitals, stomach, and intestines.)

* From the 22 letters, everything was made.

[^1]: Note, there are several ways to assign the attributes to the letters. The Sepher Yetzrah does not make an assignment explicit. Assignment for the Doubles are to what concepts they pertain to (i.e., Beth refers to Wisdom). Assignment for the Simples are to where they are predominant in (i.e. Heh is predominant in Speech). See more in [[#Links]]. 
[^2]: Classifications are based on [[Sepher Yetzirah|Sepher Yetzrah]], and [[Qabalah, Qliphoth and Goetic Magic by Karlsson|Karlsson]] respectively (separated by -)

> The production of all things from the twenty-two letters is the proof that they are all but part of one living body. [^4]

[^4]: [[Sepher Yetzirah|Sepher Yetzrah Ch. 2]]

* The Existence stemming from God is divided into four divisions: 
	* **Atsilut / Atziluth** (Emanation) - the ten emanated sefirot through which spreads the light of Ein Sof.
	* **Beriah / Briah** (Creation) - The Throne of God. The Will of God is acted on by the Archangels.
	* **Yetsirah / Yetzirah** (Formation) - comprises ten bands of angels and celestial palaces. 
	* **Assiyah / Asiyah** (Actualization)- the heavens and the material world. Actualization. It includes the ten heavens.
* The Sefirot emanate the light of Ein Sof from Atsilut to Assiyah.

### Destroyed Worlds and Evil
* One theory in Qabalah says that God created a world where the principles from the [[The Sephirot|left side]] dominate. These worlds were *destructive* and destroyed themselves. 
	* Isaac ha-Cohen posits God made three attempts which were ruled by Qamtiel, Belial, and Ittiel, each getting successively worse. Ittiel's world even wished to place themselves above the divine and chop down the Tree of Life itself. The remnants of these worlds are [[The Qliphoth]].
	* Thus, God made the world have both good (yeser ha-tob) and evil (yeser ha-ra).

* There are also the **11 Kings of Edom**, those prior to any Israelite. *Edom means A kingdom of a severity, not weakened by any pity*. 
	* Their names: Tinma, Alva, Jetet, Oholibama, Ela, Pinon, Kenas, Teman, Mibsar, Magdiel, Iram.
	* Edom was also said to be ruled by Satan.
