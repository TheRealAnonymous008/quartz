# Superbia
* "The Essence of all Sin". It contends with supremacy over the divine itself by placing more importance on the Self.
* It is being preoccupied only with the Self; to desire to always be the center of attention no matter what, even when this attention is undue.
* It is to look down on others below with arrogance, rooted in placing an unhealthy amount of value on the Self.
# Invidia
* "The Venomous Sin". It weeps at those who rejoice and rejoices over those who weep.
* It is to compare, criticize and complain, being ungrateful and hateful of others for what they have.
* It is rooted in twisted desire. The Other has something seemingly valuable, the Self must have it as well.
# Ira
* "The Fiery Sin". It lashes out at a reality deemed unacceptable and unable to be changed.
* It is the explosive power of a flawed affection, Often it comes out as an emotional response when one feels that something they love is threatened.
* It is rooted in many things, but it is mostly out of perceived helplessness and twisted self-centered love.
# Acedia
* "The Apathetic Sin". It is a soul-decaying apathy and carelessness towards others. 
* It manifests not only as idleness to improve oneself but also as indifference in general. It is simply going through the motions of life with a lack of appetite for something more.
* It is rooted in the desire for selfish comfort, for doing anything more compromises the control they have over their lives.
# Avaritia
* "The Discontented Sin". It is the excessive, unbounded desire for money and material things
* It manifests subtly. It is hoarding for fear of not having enough. It is valuing the material to the point of doing wrong. It is never finding contentment.
* It is rooted in an unhealthy desire gone wrong. The desire for acquiring things is natural, but greed misdirects this by placing the value solely on the material.
# Gula
* "The Wasteful Sin". It is directing the appetite towards improper ends. 
* It manifests as satiating the appetite in excess, but also as being picky. It is seeing the self-indulgence satisfied as the only end to life even at the expense of someone else.
* It is rooted in a lack of self-control or stability, being driven only by one's carnal appetite to fulfill some deeper need
# Luxuria
* "The Desirous Sin". It is the inordinate desire for other things, though usually the carnal and sexual.
	* It manifests in seeking an empty self-gratifying pleasure. It is being blinded by desire to the point of defiling nature and dehumanizing others.
	* It is rooted in unrepressed, unhealthy desires. It places value only on the surface-level pleasure of the experience and not on anything deeper.

* Lust is a sin because it invites someone to deviate from the pursuit of spirituality.
	* Evagirus argues that the primary source of Lust is Gluttony which gives rise to the desire for other pleasures. 
		* He advocates three countermeasures: do not satiate yourself wit food; avoid women; monitor one's fantasies vigilantly
		* Chastity is achieved if one can think of a woman without it inviting sexual desire.
	* John Cassian's view is that lust afflicts body and soul so the remedy is prayer or manual labor. 
		* Unlike the other sins, Lust must be conquered by isolating the self.
	* Amma Sarah's view is that lust is something that distracts one from devotion to God (i.e., passion).
	* To Aquinas, chastity is the proper ordering of the desire for sexual pleasure. 
		* Here, sexual acts should only be used for procreation, and so lust is when one is moved by disordered sexual desire and passion for sexual pleasure.
		* It is not the sexual desire that is sinful nor is it the sexual pleasure, but the misdirected desire towards the individual rather than society.
		* Equivalently, in this view, two consenting married adults who do not engage in sexual activity for procreation (unless they are deliberately celibate) are also engaging in sin. This is also considered Lust 

* Contemporary, secular work suggests that Lust is the virtue and Chastity is the vice. The explanation is due to shifts in attitudes towards sexual practices, although the issue stems mostly from where to draw the line between what is sexually permissible.
	* Blackburn describes lust as the enthusiastic desire, the desire that infuses the body, for sexual activity and its pleasures for their own sake.
	* Lust is a felt desire. It is also associated with excess in the sense it diverts our attention away from the rest of the world towards ecstasy. 
	* In Lust, we don't want to be in control, we want to be swept away. Lust offers a positive [[System Dynamics|Feedback loop]]. 
	* In this view, however, Lust can still be problematic when it leads one to see the other merely as an object for  pleasure. 

* At the core of the question of Lust is the sense of objectification of the other and the degree of harm it could cause (or where, even, to draw the line). 
* For two individuals who care for one another, sexual experience is not simply the satisfaction of desire, although it is surely that; it is also an expression of love.
# Tristitia
* "The Eternal Sin". It is the belief that one's own malice is greater than salvation.
* It challenges the notion of experiencing Absolute Forgiveness in the future in favor of Absolute Damnation.
* It is to abandon all hope.
