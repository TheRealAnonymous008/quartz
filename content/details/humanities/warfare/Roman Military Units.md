# Organization 
### Pre-Marian Reforms
* **Contubernium** - 8 legionnaires (contubernales) + 2 extra people (auxuilia) for packing and cooking. Led by a **decanus** . 
* **Maniple** - 120 men (60 for Triarii). 
* **Turma** - 32 horsemen
* **Legion** - 60 manipuli of infantry, and 10 turmae of cavalry. The maniples marched in checkerboard formation.

### The Marian Reforms
* Alleged changes to the composition and operation of the Roman army by Gaius Marius. The key changes are as follows: 
	* Inclusion of the common people, the **capite censi**, into the military. This bolsters the number of soldiers.
		* Pre-Marian times, the legion consisted of soldiers who owned enough property to afford their equipment.
	* Replacing the maniple with the cohort. 
		* In the cohort, men were now in a standardized unit, no longer divided by experience
		* The cohort is more flexible because it can move independent of each other.
	* The inclusion of **Marius' mules**. Legionaries carried their own supplies, which reduced the size of baggage trains. This increased the mobility of the army.
		* All equipment was now offered by the state.
		* New weapons were also introduced -- the pilum and the gladius 
	* Using the eagle standard as the symbol of the legion.

* **Contubernium** - 8 legionnaires (contubernales) + 2 extra people (auxuilia) for packing and cooking. Led by a **decanus** . 
* **Centuria / Centuries** - 10 Contubernium. Commanded by a **centurion** and his optio. 
* **Cohors / Cohort** - 6 Centuries. The most senior ranking centurion of the centuries commands the entire cohort
	* **Cohors Prima / First Cohort** - a double strength cohort. The **Primus Pilus**  was the centurion of its first Century, and was the most senior centurion of the legion .
* **Legion** - 9 cohorts + 1 Cohors Prima. Commanded by the **legatus legionis** assisted by the praefactus castorum. 
	* **Vexillatio** - a task force of centuries detached from the legion for a specific purpose. Commanded by an officer appointed by the legatus.
