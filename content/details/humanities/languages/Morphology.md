* *Intuition*: Words can be decomposed into smaller components which can be used to augment the word's meaning. 
* These components are called **morphemes**.
	* Morphemes can be **roots** or **affixes** which are attached to roots. (beginning, middle or, end for prefixes, infixes, and suffixes respectively).
	* Morphemes can be **free** - they stand as their own word or **bound** - the morpheme in itself is not a word (such as affixes)
	* **Open Class** - is a category of morphemes that can accept new members (i.e., nouns and verbs). **Closed-Class** - remains finite (i.e., preposition

* We must consider the following when identifying the morphemes of a language:
	* The sound
	* Meaning
	* Bound vs Free
	* Prefix vs Suffix vs Infix
	* What kind of morpheme can they attach to?
	* What kind of category do they create? (i.e., nouns or verbs or nouns that end in -p)
# Morphological Quirks
* **Templates** - a frame consisting of consonants or vowels which are filled in by other letters to change their meaning. (i.e., b-x-l in Egyptian)
* **Reduplication** - repeating some part of the word based on some rule.
* **Truncation** - one morpheme is deleted if it is internal to another suffix.
* **Tone** - for tonal languages, the way a morpheme is said has an effect on its meaning. 
* **Nothing Morpheme** - morphemes which are not pronounced. 

* Sometimes when morphemes are added, they can affect other morphemes in the word (sometimes due to how the word is pronounced.)
	* When a morpheme has more than one form depending on what it is combined with, the forms are called **allomorphs**.
	* The **default allomorph** is the morpheme that is used most of the time.
* Think of words as being assembled from morphemes *in a particular order*.
* *Think of morphological rules as being applied in a particular order*. 

* Some morphemes have the same form but different forms (i.e., un- (as in undoing) and un- (as in opposite of))
* Morphemes can be pronounced differently across different languages.

* Some languages are:
	* **Isolating** - have many free morphemes.
	* **Polysynthetic** - have many bound morphemes.
	* **Agglutinative** - have morphemes that are easily separable from each other.
	* **Fusional / Inflectional** - have morphemes that tend to blend together.


* **Inflectional Morphology** - those that are based on agreement, grammar, and tense. These do not change the grammatical category
* **Derivational Morphology** - those that are causative or category-changing. These change the grammatical category of the word.

* Universal morphology:
	* *Derivational Morphology is very often merged first over Inflectional Morphology*.
	* We tend to construct our mental lexicon using morphemes rather than words. We manipulate the morphemes of the language.
