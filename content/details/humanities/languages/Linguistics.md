* Language is an encoding of the different ideas of its speakers conveyed in utterances.
* **Arbitrariness of the Sign** - there is no logical intrinsic relationship between sound pattern and concept (not applicable in some cases, but generally true)

* Although some features (i.e., morphological, syntactical) can be easy to imagine for a given language, in practice, these do not exist, possibly because of how humans construct and use languages. [[Thinking Fast And Slow|We favor simplicity]].

* For exploration: [Grice's Maxims of Conversation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_principle#:~:text=Accordingly%2C%20the%20cooperative%20principle%20is,in%20pursuit%20of%20effective%20communication.)

* [Jakobson's Functions of Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakobson%27s_functions_of_language) . Each function is characterized with a message that has a particular focus 
	* **Referential** - focuses on context and describes a situation or state. 
	* **Poetic** - focuses on the message for its own sake (i.e., calling attention to how it is used)
	* **Emotive** - focuses on the Sender and their own self-expression 
	* **Conative** - focuses on the Receiver directly, can be characterized by imperatives or vocatives 
	* **Phatic** - focuses on the Channel; it is using language for the sake of interaction and to start, facilitate, and stop interaction with others 
	* **Metalingual** - focuses on the Code; it is using language that describes tself.
