* [^lyu_2023] provides a theoretical and empirical analysis of the use of Centralized Critics in CTDE.

* [^Kim_2023]   introduces a new mutual information framework for MARL. This leads to the development of an algorithm called **Variational Maximum Mutual Information, Multi-Agent Actor Critic** which allows agents to coordinate simultaneous actions without latency.
