* [^ardon_2022] propose an [[Agent Based Modeling|ABM]] network that is compatible with the use of [[Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning|MARL]] .  The framework encodes the following
	* Partial Observability. 
	* A network model for inter-agent relationships.  Connectivity can either be static or stochastic. 
	* Agent Utility Functions encapsulated as [[Game Theory - Games|types]].
	* Heterogeneous Agent Preferences
	* Support for complex turn orders (i.e., turns based on types)

* [^lyu_2023] provides a theoretical and empirical analysis of the use of Centralized Critics in CTDE.

* [^Kim_2023]   introduces a new mutual information framework for MARL. This leads to the development of an algorithm called **Variational Maximum Mutual Information, Multi-Agent Actor Critic** which allows agents to coordinate simultaneous actions without latency.
