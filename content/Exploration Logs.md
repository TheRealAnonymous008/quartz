* [A better way to handle worldbuilding in games is to make the player care about the setting -- treat the world not just as a backdrop but as a world that the player inhabits and interacts with. Make players care about the world rather than giving them all the answers.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bups0ZUQdvc)

* [^Kim_2023]   introduces a new mutual information framework for MARL. This leads to the development of an algorithm called **Variational Maximum Mutual Information, Multi-Agent Actor Critic** which allows agents to coordinate simultaneous actions without latency.
