* Consider the scale of the map -- does everyone in the world know (roughly) all the places in the map or not? 

* Consider the *shape of the landmasses* and the proportion of landmasses to the water. 
	* A way to [[details/creativity/design/DOET/Design Thinking|Prototype]] the shape of the coastline is using something malleable [^1]
	* Take real world maps and coastlines and then rotate them around. This has the advantage of having realistic coastlines. 

* Consider the *plate tectonics* 
	* *Rule of thumb*: The fault lines should not meet in corners. 
	* Since the planet is a sphere, the right and the left drawing of the fault lines (when projected onto 2D) should match up.
	* Place the landmasses (generally) on the continental plates, and the water on the oceanic plates.
	* *Rule of thumb*: There is one section between oceanic plates where they diverge, and one section between continental plates where they converge (of course plates can rotate).
	* Consider the plate boundaries (convergent, divergent and transform)

[^1]: WASD20 recommends using beans, but you can easily do this with anything that lets you sculpt (or example [[Pixel Art]]).

* Consider the [[Winds and Atmospheric Kinetics]], specifically the different wind speeds.
