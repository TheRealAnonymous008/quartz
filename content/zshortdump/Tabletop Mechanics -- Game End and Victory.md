* **Victory Points and Game State** - An event causes the Game State to be evaluated relative to some scoring condition. Players earn points based on how that state matches the condition. There are a variety of score triggers
	* **Scheduled**  - there are predefined intervals for when scoring will happen, and players know when they are approaching
		* A Scheduled trigger is best suited for more strategic games, as it allows for long-term planning
		* If players [[Dynamic Games of Complete Information|know]] exactly when scoring will occur, the final actions leading up to scoring can be subject to over-analysis and game lengthening delays as players attempt to optimize their scores,
	* **Player Action** - players are the ones who trigger scoring.
		* Sometimes this is completely at the discretion of the players
		* sometimes the precise timing falls within a band of possible values
		* Excellent at creating tension but can reward players who simply happened to be in a superior position when scoring occurs
	* **Random** - there are Scoring cards or tokens that are mixed in with other items. When these are drawn, scoring occurs
		* Can be highly strategic or quite tactical, depending on implementation
