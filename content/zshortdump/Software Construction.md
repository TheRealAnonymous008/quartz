* Building software is not just a matter of [[Programming]] but also about design, planning, testing, integration, optimization, organization and documentation.
* Knowing how to properly construct software makes the programmer more productive and is reflective of their skill.
* Knowing how to make the code [[Clean Code Principles|clean]] makes documentation and understanding of the software easier. *The quality of construction affects the quality of software*. 

* Treating software construction as similar to building construction suggests that *careful preparation is needed* and illuminates the difference between large and small projects.
	* A well-planned project improves your ability to change your mind later about details
* Thinking of software-development practices as tools in an intellectual toolbox suggests further that every programmer has many tools and that no single tool is right for every job. *Choosing the right tool for each problem is one key to being an effective programmer.*
