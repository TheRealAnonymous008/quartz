* A [[Probability Theory|stochastic process]] is said to be **Markovian** or has the **Markov Property** if the next state is only dependent on the previous state. That is, if we let $X_t$ be the state at time $t$ then 
  $$
  P(X_{t+1} \mid X_t,\dots, X_0) = P(X_{t+1} \mid X_t)
  $$
* A Markov process is *memoryless*. It does not remember the history of past states beyond the current state.
