* There are seven aspects of character flaws. There are parallels to the [[Seven Deadly Sins]].
	* **Impatience** - the character hates it whenever anything interferes with their will.
	* **Martyrdom** - the character feels a constant need to blame others for their own actions, as though they have no will of their own.
	  
	* **Greed** - the character feels a need to grasp and hoard as though there were an intolerable lack of some vital substance.
	* **Self-Destruction** - the character's very existence is increasingly intolerable. There is a constant inner turmoil that makes them want to get away from themselves 
	  
	* **Arrogance** - the character feels a need to be seen as better than others because being ordinary is intolerable 
	* **Self-deprecation** - the character feels a need to be seen as little as possible because they believe themselves to be miserably inadequate. 

	* **Stubbornness** - the character feels a need to keep all things just as they are and resist any outside influence, even positive ones.

* Under this system, we can observe parallels to [[Jungian Archetypal Characters|Jungian archetypes]]
	* The **persona** layer is the cover to hide the shadow.
	* The **shadow** is hidden underneath a layer of negativity and denial. It is single-minded, desperate, being driven by their worst fears.
	* **Fear** is at the core of emotions. This is reminiscent of the [[Enneagram of Personality]]. The character's flaw is an attempt to avoid a kind of fear. 

* Each chief feature has a fundamental fear associated with them
