* The goal of chaos theory is to study the [[System Dynamics|dynamics]] of a system which exhibits semi-unpredictable behavior. That is *behavior that appears disorderly yet still has some structure to it.*
* *Chaotic systems are [[Information Theory|information rich]]*. They carry more information because their behaviors are surprising.
