# Instruments
* The harmonic pattern of an instrument is dependent on the superposition of different frequencies and normal modes. The **harmonic content** is the extent to which frequencies higher than the fundamental are present and it is dependent on how the wave was produced

* Stringed instruments produce sound using [[Mechanical Waves|standing waves]] which cause the air to vibrate. The sound is dependent on the length of the string.
* *Tuning an instrument boils down to getting the instrument  to play at the correct frequency by adjusting the mechanism with which it produces sound*
