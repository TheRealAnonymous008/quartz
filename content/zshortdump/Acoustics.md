* **Sound** is formally a longitudinal wave that propagates through a medium, most typically air. 
	* Sound is perceived by the human [[Anatomy|ear]]. The audible range is $20-20000 \ \ \text{Hz}$
	* Sound can be described as fluctuations in [[Fluid Mechanics|pressure]]. The fluctuation is dependent on the sound's frequency.
# Instruments
* The harmonic pattern of an instrument is dependent on the superposition of different frequencies and normal modes. The **harmonic content** is the extent to which frequencies higher than the fundamental are present and it is dependent on how the wave was produced

* Stringed instruments produce sound using [[Mechanical Waves|standing waves]] which cause the air to vibrate. The sound is dependent on the length of the string.
* *Tuning an instrument boils down to getting the instrument  to play at the correct frequency by adjusting the mechanism with which it produces sound*
