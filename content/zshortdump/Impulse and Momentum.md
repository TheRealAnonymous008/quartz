* The **linear momentum** of a particle, denoted $\vec{p}$ is defined as 
  
  $$
  \vec{p} = m\vec{v}
  $$
  *Momentum quantifies motion*.

* The **impulse** of an external force us defined as the product of the net external force and the time interval
  
  $$
  \vec{J} = \vec F_\text{net} \ \cdot \Delta t
  $$
  For a varying force, we have that 
  
  $$
  \vec{J} = \int \vec{F} (t) \ dt
  $$
