* **Adaptation Level** - evaluation is relative to a neutral reference point. *Tastes are not fixed, they vary with this reference point*.
* **Diminishing Sensitivity** - sensitivity depends on scale. Small increments are only noticeable at small scales.
* **Loss Aversion** - There is an asymmetry where we weigh a loss more than an equal gain.
	* Evolutionarily, this makes sense. An organism that perceives threats as more urgent survives better.
	* A byproduct of this is a single bad in many good things stands out more, and a single good in many bad things stands out less.
	* *This makes negotiations more difficult*. the exploitation of market power to impose losses on others is unacceptable
