* A **subnormal (subinvariant) series** of a group $G$ is a finite sequence $H_0,H_1,\dots, H_n$ of [[Subgroup|subgroups]] of $G$ such that $H_i < H_{i+1}$ and $H_i$ is a [[Normal Group|normal subgroup]] of $H_{i+1}$ and $H_0=\set{e}$ and $H_n=G$.
* A **normal (invariant) series** of $G$ is a finite sequence $H_0,H_1,\dots, H_n$ of normal subgroups of $G$ such that $H_i < H_{i+1}$, $H_0=\set{e}$ and $H_n=G$.

* A subnormal (normal) series $\set{K_j}$ is a **refinement** of a subnormal (normal) series $\set{H_i}$ of a group $G$ if $\set{H_i}\subseteq \set{K_j}$. That is, if each $H_i$ is one of the $K_j$.

* Two subnormal (normal) series $\set{H_i}$ and $\set{K_j}$ of the same group $G$ are **isomorphic** if there is a one-to-one correspondence between the collections of factor groups $\set{H_{i+1}/H_i}$ and $\set{K_{j+1}/K_j}$ such that the corresponding [[Factor Group|factor groups]] are isomorphic.
