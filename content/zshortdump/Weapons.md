* In modern day settings, the design of the weapon is indicative of the nation's policies on warfare -- whether that be offense or defense oriented. 

* **Sword Breaker / Degenbrecher** - a dagger with teeth on one side of it. The teeth are designed to catch the opponent's sword and hold it in place.
	* It acts more as a disruptor than an offensive weapon. It is mainly used so that an attack can be made for the brief moment the enemy is disrupted.
	* It also slows down the weapon rather than deflecting it.
	* It is a bit counterintuitive to use since it requires the blade to be oriented in a particular way to catch the incoming sword.

* *Mines have remained an indiscriminate danger*. There is always a risk of detonating them. 
	* They have been used to protect important military assets and as a form of area denial (i.e., prevent a road from being used by the enemy)
	* Some techniques to counter mines:
		* Improved Personnel equipment and vehicle armor. This includes material to prevent shrapnel from entering the body. 
		* Imaging techniques
		* Surveillance
		* Radio Jamming to prevent triggers from activating
		* Chemical detection
		* Ground penetrating radar
		* Rapid UAV strikes
		* Search dogs

* An **Assault Intervention Vehicle** (AIV) is designed to deploy members of an assault team rapidly into a target area. They allow for assault mobility, access height, speed, and flexibility for any situation.

* Weapon **caches** are used to help resupply a soldier in case of an emergency. The location of the cache is kept hidden 
	* They are often made of surplus equipment.
