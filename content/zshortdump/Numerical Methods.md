* The goal is to solve continuous problems using numeric approximation. 
* Applying the methods of Numerical Methods requires knowledge on [[Computer Number Formats|binary and computer number formats]]. Note that *imprecisions due to how numbers are stored can cascade to inaccuracies when using numerical methods*.
