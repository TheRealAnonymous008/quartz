* One approach to analyzing [[Swarm Intelligence|swarms]] is to abstract interactions between swarm agents using [[Network Science|networks]]. 
* Edges in the network are interpreted as enabling information to flow between vertices. 
	* In a **static network** edges are static -- they are not time dependent.
	* In a **dynamic network**, edges are time dependent. Edges can be created or destroyed in the network
	* In a **[[Random Network]]**, edges are time dependent and also [[Probability Theory|stochastic]].
