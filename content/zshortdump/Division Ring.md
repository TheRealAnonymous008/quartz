* Assuming it exists, $1$ is the multiplicative identity (also called **unity**). *The multiplicative identity need not exist.*
* An element $u\in R$ is a **unit** of $R$ if it has a multiplicative inverse. That is $u^{-1}$ is defined so that
  $$
  u\cdot u^{-1} = 1
  $$
* If every nonzero element of $R$ is a unit, then $R$ is a **division [[Fundamental Constructs of Ring Theory|ring]]**. 
	* If it is commutative, we call it a [[Field]].
	* Otherwise we call it a **strictly skew field**.
* (*Fraleigh e18.42*) The multiplicative inverse of a unit is unique.
