* The lenses allow us to listen to ourselves, the game, the player, the team, and the general culture better.

### 1. Emotion
* Make sure the [[Games as Play#Play of Pleasure|feelings]] you create are the right ones. 
* But beware [[Confirmation Bias|Observer bias]] and how that influences analysis.

* What emotions would I like my player to experience? Why
* What emotions are players (including me) having when they play now? Why?
* How can I bridge the gap between the emotions players are having and the emotions I’d like them to have?

### 2. Essential Experience
* Stop thinking about your game and start thinking about the [[Games as Play|experience]] of the player.
* Remember that games do not fully capture real experiences. Real experiences can only serve as inspiration for essential experiences.

* What experience do I want the player to have?
* What is essential to that experience?
* How can my game capture that essence?

### 3. Venue
* The places that we play exert tremendous influence on the design of our games.

* What type of venue best suits the game I’m trying to create
* Does my venue have special properties that will influence my game?
* What elements of my game are in harmony with my venue? What elements are not?

### 4. Surprise
* Surprise is a crucial part of entertainment.

* What will surprise players when they play my game?
* Does the story in my game have surprises? Do the game rules? Does the artwork? The technology?
* Do your rules give players ways to surprise each other?
* Do your rules give players ways to surprise themselves?

### 5. Fun
* Sometimes fun defies analysis

* What parts of my game are fun? Why?
* What parts need to be more fun?

### 6. Curiosity
* Think about the player's true motivations -- not just the goals set forth by the game, but the reason the player wants to achieve these goals.

* What questions does my game put into the player’s mind
* What am I doing to make them care about these questions
* What can I do to make them invent even more questions?

### 7. Endogenous Value
* A game’s success hinges on the players’ willingness to [[The Fundamentals of Game Design#Entering the Game|pretend]] it is important, and by proxy how willing they are to succeed in the game.

* What is valuable to the players in my game?
* How can I make it more valuable to them?
* What is the relationship between value in the game and the players’ motivations?

### 8 . Problem Solving
* Think about the [[Puzzle|problems]] your players must solve to succeed at the game.

* What problems does my game ask the player to solve?
* Are there hidden problems to solve that arise as part of gameplay?
* How can my game generate new problems so that players keep coming back?

### 9. Elemental Tetrad
* Games consist of Mechanics, Story, Aesthetics, and Technology. Consider them separately and then together

* Is my game design using elements of all four types?
* Could my design be improved by enhancing elements in one or more of the categories?
* Are the four elements in harmony, reinforcing each other and working together toward a common theme?

### 10. Holographic Design
* See everything in your game at once. The [[#9. Elemental Tetrad|elements]] and the player experience and how they interrelate. 

* What elements of the game make the experience enjoyable?
* What elements of the game detract from the experience? 
* How can I change game elements to improve the experience?

### 11. Unification
* Works well with [[#9. Elemental Tetrad]] for dissecting the game and identifying how to unify them with a common theme. 

* What is my theme?
* Am I using every means possible to reinforce that theme?

### 12. Resonance
* The best games are those that resonate with us deeply.

* What is it about my game that feels powerful and special?
* When I describe my game to people, what ideas get them really excited?
* If I had no constraints of any kind, what would this game be like?
* I have certain instincts about how this game should be. What is driving those instincts?

### 13. Infinite Inspiration 
* What is an experience I have had in my life that I would want to share with others?
* In what small way can I capture the essence of that experience and put it into my game?
* Synergizes with [[#2. Essential Experience]]. 

### 14. The Problem Statement 
* Think of the game as the solution to a problem. 
* Define the constraints and goals of the game. 

* What problem, or problems, am I really trying to solve?
* Have I been making assumptions about this game that really have nothing to do with its true purpose?
* Is a game really the best solution? Why?
* How will I be able to tell if the problem is solved?

### 15. The Eight Filters 
* Think of the game design problem as a constraint satisfaction problem. We are done with our design when at the very least we can answer the following questions. 

* *Artistic Impulse* Does this game feel right?
* *Demographics* Will the intended audience like this game enough? 
* *Experience Design* Is this a well-designed game?
* *Innovation* Is this game novel enough?
* *Business and Marketing* Will this game sell?
* *Engineering* Is it technically possible to build this game?
* *Social Community* Does this game meet our social and community goals?
* *Playtesting* Do the playtesters enjoy this game enough?

### 16. Risk Mitigation 
* Stop thinking positively and start considering things that could go horribly wrong with the game.

* What could keep this game from being great?
* How can we stop that from happening?

### 17. The Toy
* Stop thinking about whether your game is fun to play, and start thinking about whether it is fun to play with.

* If my game had no goal, would it be fun at all? If not, how can I change that?
* When people see my game, do they want to start interacting with it, even before they know what to do? If not, how can I change that?

* Use this lens to either: 
	* Identify the toy-like qualities to the game. 
	* Identify how to invent and create new toys before even making the game. 

### 18. Passion 
* At the end of each prototype, when you are carefully mitigating risks and planning what to do next, don’t forget to check how you feel about the game. 

* Am I filled with blinding passion about how great this game will be?
* If I’ve lost the passion, can I find it again?
* If the passion isn’t coming back, shouldn’t I be doing something else?

### 19. The Player 
* Stop thinking about the game and start thinking about the player. 

* In general, what do they like?
* What don’t they like? Why?
* What do they expect to see in a game?
* If I were in their place, what would I want to see in a game?
* What would they like or dislike about my game in particular?

* Synergizes with [[#10. Holographic Design|Holographic Design]]. 
* Even more useful than thinking about the player, is watching them play -- the more you observe, the more easily you'll be able to predict what they are going to enjoy.

### 20. Pleasure 
* Think about the kinds of pleasure the game does and does not provide. 
* The goal of a game is [[Games as Play#Play of Pleasure|pleasure]].  Go through [[Players and Why We Play Games|paradigms for pleasure]] and reflect on the game. 
* Alternatively, take inspiration from unique, unclassified pleasures.

* What pleasures does your game give to players? Can these be improved?
* What pleasures are missing from your experience? Why? Can they be added?


### 21. Flow
* From the [[Flow State Model]].

* Does my game have clear goals? If not, how can I fix that?
* Are the goals of the player the same goals I intended?
* Are there parts of the game that distract players to the point they forget their goal? If so, can these distractions be reduced or tied into the game goals?
* Does my game provide a steady stream of not-too-easy, not-too-hard challenges, taking into account the fact that the player’s skills may be gradually improving?
* Are the player’s skills improving at the rate I had hoped? If not, how can I change that?

### 22. Needs
* Stop thinking about the game and start thinking about what basic human [[Models for Human Needs|needs]] it fulfills. 

* On which levels of Maslow’s hierarchy is my game operating?
* Does it fill the needs of competence, autonomy, and relatedness?
* How can I make my game fill more basic needs than it already does?
* For the needs my game is already filling, how can it fill those needs even better?

* The game cannot just promise the need, it must deliver fulfillment of the need. 

### 23. Motivation 
* Every game is a complex ecosystem of motivations 

* What motivations do players have to play my game?
* Which motivations are most internal? Which are most external?
* Which are pleasure seeking? Which are pain avoiding?
* Which motivations support each other?
* Which motivations are in conflict?

### 24. Novelty 
* What is novel about my game?
* Does my game have novelties throughout or just at the beginning?
* Do I have the right mix of the novel and the familiar?
* When the novelty wears off, will players still enjoy my game?

### 25. Judgment 
* The game is a good judge of the players. 

* What does your game judge about the players?
* How does it communicate this judgment?
* Do players feel the judgment is fair?
* Do they care about the judgment?
* Does the judgment make them want to improve?

### 26. Functional Space 
* Think about the space in which the game really takes pace in when all surface elements are stripped away. 

* Is the space of this game discrete or continuous?
* How many dimensions does it have?
* What are the boundaries of the space?
* Are there subspaces? How are they connected?
* Is there more than one useful way to abstractly model the space of this game?

* Works well with [[#10. Holographic Design]] since we can match the functional space with the aesthetic space the player will experience. [[Architecture]] principles apply.

### 27. Time 
* Experiences can be spoiled if they are too fast, too slow, too long or too short. 

* What is it that determines the length of my gameplay activities?
* Are my players frustrated because the game ends too early? How can I change that?
* Are my players bored because the game goes on too long? How can I change that?
* Would clocks or races make my gameplay more exciting?
* Time limits can irritate players. Would I better off without time limits?
* Would a hierarchy of time structures help my game? That is, several short rounds that together comprise a larger round?

### 28. State Machine 
* [[Finite Automata and Regular Languages|More on state machines here]].
* Think about what information changes during the game. 

* What are the objects in my game?
* What are the attributes of the objects?
* What are the possible states for each attribute?
* What triggers the state changes for each attribute?

* States and attributes present information which is core to the mechanics of any game. 

### 29. Secrets 
* Change who has what information and you change your game completely. Think about who knows what and why 

* What is known by the game only?
* What is known by all players?
* What is known by some or only one player?
* Would changing who knows what information improve my game in some way?

* Who knows about what attributes can change over the course of the game. 

### 30. Emergence 
* How many verbs do my players have?
* How many objects can each verb act on?
* How many ways can players achieve their goals?
* How many subjects do the players control?
* How do side effects change constraints?

### 31. Action 
* What can the player do and not do and why? 

* What are the basic actions in my game?
* What are the strategic actions?
* What strategic actions would I like to see? How can I change my game in order to make those possible?
* Am I happy with the ratio of strategic to basic actions?
* What actions do players wish they could do in my game that they cannot?
* Can I somehow enable these, either as basic or strategic actions?

### 32. Goals 
* What is the ultimate goal of my game?
* Is that goal clear to players?
* If there is a series of goals, do the players understand that?
* Are the different goals related to each other in a meaningful way?
* Are my goals concrete, achievable, and rewarding?
* Do I have a good balance of short- and long-term goals?
* Do players have a chance to decide on their own goals?

* Synergizes well with [[#17. The Toy]] and [[#6. Curiosity]]. 

### 33. Rules 
* What are the foundational rules of my game? How do these differ from the operational rules?
* Are there “laws” or “house rules” that are forming as the game develops? Should these be incorporated into my game directly?
* Are there different modes in my game? Do these modes make things simpler, or more complex? Would the game be better with fewer modes? More modes?
* Who enforces the rules?
* Are the rules easy to understand, or is there confusion about them? If there is confusion, should I fix it by changing the rules or by explaining them more clearly?

* Since games are defined by their rules, give them time and consideration. 
* Experimentation is key. 

### 34. Skill 
* Start looking at the skills you are asking of the players 

* What skills does my game require from the player?
* Are there categories of skill that this game is missing?
* Which skills are dominant?
* Are these skills creating the experience I want?
* Are some players much better at these skills than others? Does this make the game feel unfair?
* Can players improve their skills with practice, leading to a feeling of mastery?
* Does this game demand the right level of skill?

* Use this as a window to define the player experience. The [[#2. Essential Experience]].

### 35. Expected Value 
* [[Random Variables and Probability Distributions|See more here]]. 
* Think about the chance of different events occurring and what those mean to the player. 

* What is the actual chance of a certain event occurring?
* What is the perceived chance?
* What value does the outcome of that event have? Can the value be quantified? Are there intangible aspects of value that I am not considering?
* Each action a player can take has a different expected value when I add up all the possible outcomes. Am I happy with these values? Do they give the player interesting choices? Are they too rewarding, or too punishing?

* The challenge of using it is finding a way to numerically represent everything that can happen to a player.

### 36. Chance
* Focus on the parts that involve randomness and risk, keeping in mind they are not the same. 

* What in my game is truly random? What parts just feel random?
* Does the randomness give the players positive feelings of excitement and challenge, or does it give them negative feelings of hopelessness and lack of control?
* Would changing my probability distribution curves improve my game?
* Do players have the opportunity to take interesting risks in the game?
* What is the relationship between chance and skill in my game? Are there ways I can make random elements feel more like the exercise of a skill? Are there ways I can make exercising skills feel more like risk taking?

### 37. Fairness 

### 38. Challenge 

### 39. Meaningful Choices 

### 40. Triangularity 

### 41. Skill vs Chance 

### 42. Heads and Hands 

### 43. Competition

### 45. Competition vs Cooperation 
* Obviously synergizes with [[#43. Competition]] and [[#44. Cooperation]]

### 46. Reward 

### 47. Punishment 

### 48. Simplicity / Complexity 

### 49. Elegance

### 50. Character
