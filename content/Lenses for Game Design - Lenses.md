* The lenses allow us to listen to our game better. 

### 1. Emotion
* Make sure the [[Games as Play#Play of Pleasure|feelings]] you create are the right ones. 
* But beware [[Confirmation Bias|Observer bias]] and how that influences analysis.

* What emotions would I like my player to experience? Why
* What emotions are players (including me) having when they play now? Why?
* How can I bridge the gap between the emotions players are having and the emotions I’d like them to have?

### 2. Essential Experience
* Stop thinking about your game and start thinking about the [[Games as Play|experience]] of the player.
* Remember that games do not fully capture real experiences. Real experiences can only serve as inspiration for essential experiences.

* What experience do I want the player to have?
* What is essential to that experience?
* How can my game capture that essence?

### 3. Venue
* The places that we play exert tremendous influence on the design of our games.

* What type of venue best suits the game I’m trying to create
* Does my venue have special properties that will influence my game?
* What elements of my game are in harmony with my venue? What elements are not?

### 4. Surprise
* Surprise is a crucial part of entertainment.

* What will surprise players when they play my game?
* Does the story in my game have surprises? Do the game rules? Does the artwork? The technology?
* Do your rules give players ways to surprise each other?
* Do your rules give players ways to surprise themselves?

### 5. Fun
* Sometimes fun defies analysis

* What parts of my game are fun? Why?
* What parts need to be more fun?

### 6. Curiosity
* Think about the player's true motivations -- not just the goals set forth by the game, but the reason the player wants to achieve these goals.

* What questions does my game put into the player’s mind
* What am I doing to make them care about these questions
* What can I do to make them invent even more questions?

### 7. Endogenous Value
* A game’s success hinges on the players’ willingness to [[The Fundamentals of Game Design#Entering the Game|pretend]] it is important, and by proxy how willing they are to succeed in the game.

* What is valuable to the players in my game?
* How can I make it more valuable to them?
* What is the relationship between value in the game and the players’ motivations?

### 8 . Problem Solving
* Think about the problems your players must solve to succeed at the game.

* What problems does my game ask the player to solve?
* Are there hidden problems to solve that arise as part of gameplay?
* How can my game generate new problems so that players keep coming back?

### 9. Elemental Tetrad
* Games consist of Mechanics, Story, Aesthetics, and Technology. Consider them separately and then together

* Is my game design using elements of all four types?
* Could my design be improved by enhancing elements in one or more of the categories?
* Are the four elements in harmony, reinforcing each other and working together toward a common theme?

### 10. Holographic Design
* See everything in your game at once. The [[#9. Elemental Tetrad|elements]] and the player experience and how they interrelate. 

* What elements of the game make the experience enjoyable?
* What elements of the game detract from the experience? 
* How can I change game elements to improve the experience?

### 11. Unification
* Works well with [[#9. Elemental Tetrad]] for dissecting the game and identifying how to unify them with a common theme. 

* What is my theme?
* Am I using every means possible to reinforce that theme?

### 12. Resonance
* The best games are those that resonate with us deeply.

* What is it about my game that feels powerful and special?
* When I describe my game to people, what ideas get them really excited?
* If I had no constraints of any kind, what would this game be like?
* I have certain instincts about how this game should be. What is driving those instincts?

### 13. Infinite Inspiration 
* What is an experience I have had in my life that I would want to share with others?
* In what small way can I capture the essence of that experience and put it into my game?
* Synergizes with [[#2. Essential Experience]]. 

### 14. The Problem Statement 
* Think of the game as the solution to a problem. 
* Define the constraints and goals of the game. 

* What problem, or problems, am I really trying to solve?
* Have I been making assumptions about this game that really have nothing to do with its true purpose?
* Is a game really the best solution? Why?
* How will I be able to tell if the problem is solved?

### 15. The Eight Filters 
* Think of the game design problem as a constraint satisfaction problem. We are done with our design when at the very least we can answer the following questions. 

* *Artistic Impulse* Does this game feel right?
* *Demographics* Will the intended audience like this game enough? 
* *Experience Design* Is this a well-designed game?
* *Innovation* Is this game novel enough?
* *Business and Marketing* Will this game sell?
* *Engineering* Is it technically possible to build this game?
* *Social Community* Does this game meet our social and community goals?
* *Playtesting* Do the playtesters enjoy this game enough?

### 16. Risk Mitigation 
* Stop thinking positively and start considering things that could go horribly wrong with the game.

* What could keep this game from being great?
* How can we stop that from happening?

### 17. The Toy
* Stop thinking about whether your game is fun to play, and start thinking about whether it is fun to play with.

* If my game had no goal, would it be fun at all? If not, how can I change that?
* When people see my game, do they want to start interacting with it, even before they know what to do? If not, how can I change that?

* Use this lens to either: 
	* Identify the toy-like qualities to the game. 
	* Identify how to invent and create new toys before even making the game. 

### 18. Passion 
* At the end of each prototype, when you are carefully mitigating risks and planning what to do next, don’t forget to check how you feel about the game. 

* Am I filled with blinding passion about how great this game will be?
* If I’ve lost the passion, can I find it again?
* If the passion isn’t coming back, shouldn’t I be doing something else?

### 19. The Player 

### 20. Pleasure
