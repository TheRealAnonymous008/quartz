### 1. Emotion
* Make sure the [[Games as Play#Play of Pleasure|feelings]] you create are the right ones. 
* But beware [[Confirmation Bias|Observer bias]] and how that influences analysis.

* What emotions would I like my player to experience? Why
* What emotions are players (including me) having when they play now? Why?
* How can I bridge the gap between the emotions players are having and the emotions Iâ€™d like them to have?

### 2. Essential Experience
* Stop thinking about your game and start thinking about the [[Games as Play|experience]] of the player.
* Remember that games do not fully capture real experiences. Real experiences can only serve as inspiration for essential experiences.

* What experience do I want the player to have?
* What is essential to that experience?
* How can my game capture that essence?
