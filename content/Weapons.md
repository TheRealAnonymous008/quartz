* In modern day settings, the design of the weapon is indicative of the nation's policies on warfare -- whether that be offense or defense oriented. 

* **Sword Breaker / Degenbrecher** - a dagger with teeth on one side of it. The teeth are designed to catch the opponent's sword and hold it in place.
	* It acts more as a disruptor than an offensive weapon. It is mainly used so that an attack can be made for the brief moment the enemy is disrupted.
	* It also slows down the weapon rather than deflecting it.
	* It is a bit counterintuitive to use since it requires the blade to be oriented in a particular way to catch the incoming sword.
