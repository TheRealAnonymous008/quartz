* $G, H$ - graph.
* $D$ - directed graph

* $V(G), V$ - vertex set (of $G$)
* $E(G), E$ - edge set (of $G$)
* $A(D),A$ - arc set of directed graph $D$.
* $x\leftrightarrow y$ - adjacency relation
* $xy$ - edge $(x,y)$
* $e$ - generic edge.
* $v$ - generic vertex
* $w(e)$ - weight of edge $e$ in weighted graph.

* $n$ - usually denotes the size of the vertex set.
* $m$ - usually denotes the size of the edge / arc set.

* $A(G), A$ - adjacency matrix of $G$
* $B(G), B$ - incidence matrix of $G$
* $w(G)$ - weight of the weighted graph $G$.

* $G\cong H$ - $G$ is isomorphic to $H$
* $G\subseteq H$ - $G$ is a subgraph of $H$.
* $G\subset H$ - $G$ is a proper subgraph of $H$.
* $G[S]$ - induced subgraph
* $\bar{G}$ - complement of the graph.
