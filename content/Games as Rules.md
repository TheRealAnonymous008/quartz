* **Rules** - the deep formal  structure of a game from which all real-world instances of the game's play are derived.  
* If you can't identify the core rules o a digital game, you are out of touch with your own design.
# What are Rules?
* Rules have the following general characteristics
	* Limit player action. *To play a game is to voluntarily restrict behaviors according to the rules*.
	* Explicit and unambiguous. 
	* Shared by all players.
	* Fixed. They do not change as a game is played. If they are modified, they are done so in a regulated manner determined by other fundamental rules.
	* Binding. They are meant to be followed over the course of the game.
	* Repeatable. Portable between setups of different players.
* There are three kinds of rules
	* **Operational** - the guidelines player require in order to play. The rules written out.
		* It concerns external, representational events that impact player interactivity.
	* **Constitutive** - the formal, logical, and mathematical structures underlying the game. The need not correspond to material form, but most likely correspond to relationships between items. 
		* They are concerned with the events corresponding to processing player choice rather than events that represent the choice.
	* **Implicit** - unwritten rules that concern etiquette, good sportsmanship and other implied rules of proper game behavior.
		* It also includes underlying assumptions. *Questioning Implicit rules can give good design ideas*.
	* *The Constitutive and Operational rules work together to generate the formal meaning of a game.*

# Games as Formal Systems
### Emergent Systems
* *Emergence and Complexity  a crucial aspect of games since they are systems*. They allow the game to be more systemic and meaningful.
* Complexity can arise unexpectedly from a handful of simple elements and rules. It is systematic order that emerges from the dynamic interactions of agents within an environment.
	* We may be able to describe the rules of the game with simple statements, but *we can never determine how the game itself will play out*.
* *In parts where meaningful play exist -- some aspect of the game system will be complex* 
	* *Parts are coupled*, interrelate with one another in a recursive manner, and generate unpredictable patterns of behavior.
	* Interactions within a game are *context-dependent* meaning the changes that occur are not the same very time.
* In games, emergence arises through the interaction of the formal game system with the decisions made by the players.
	* If the game system is not complex it does not provide a large possibility space for players to inhabit and explore through meaningful play.
	* *Be specific when defining the relationships between elements in the game*.

* *Game design is about creating experiences but indirectly and only through designing the rules.*.
	* We must account for the complex interactions between game elements that lead to emergent gameplay. 
	* Emergent systems allow us to reward players for exploring new ways to play the game. 
	* Often, *rules need to be tuned to create a rich play experience*. 

### Systems of Uncertainty
* *Uncertainty about the outcome of a game is a necessary ingredient in giving a game a feeling of purpose*. Players shouldn't know how a game will play out.
* There are two levels at which uncertainty operates in a game. 
	* On the micro-level are the actual operations of chance that occur at isolated moments in the system of a game. 
	* On the macro-level are larger questions of uncertainty, which relate to the ultimate outcome of the game.
* Without uncertainty the outcome of the game is predetermined -- player choice is rendered meaningless as they do not impact the outcome of the game.
* To make games more meaningful, there is a balance between the following.
	* **Risk** - a situation where there is some uncertainty but the game's players know the nature of the uncertainty.
	* **Uncertainty** - players have no idea about the outcome of the game
* *The feeling of randomness in a game is more important than having randomness itself* -- that is, games should not have a certain outcome.
	* Less Random = more dry / more competitive.
	* More random = More chaotic and unstructured.
		* Even the simple act of choosing to play, as much as the game is random, can be meaningful if the player has [[The Fundamentals of Game Design#Player Choice|choice]]. 
		* *In games of pure chance, the player's relation to the system needs to be carefully designed*
* *When having elements with RNG, understand [[Probability and Statistics]] first* to pace the game in an appropriate manner.
* Beware of when Uncertainty breaks down into an non-meaningful player experience:
	* Make sure your randomization functions are actually random (i.e., follow the target distribution you are aiming for.) *Changes in the randomization can lead to unexpected errors.*
	* Make sure the procedures for determining randomness operate how you intend them to. Remember that *players may use the randomness itself strategically, in ways you do not intend.*
	* Remember that players are prone to [[Human Biases|fallacies about probability.]] Thus, *understand how players misinterpret randomness*.
