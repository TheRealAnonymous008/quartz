* [Lonomia obliqua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonomia_obliqua) is the deadliest caterpillar due to its urticating seate. The setae essentially act like hypodermic needles which injects a venom that causes internal bleeding. 

* [Bees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6hGjh9SJ_M) have some displays of intelligence ranging from knowing basic arithmetic to learning by imitation. 
	* They can also tell distances through optical flow which involves judging the rate at which the ground beneath them appears to move. This is why bees die when underneath still water because they cannot tell the distance they have travelled. 
	* They can communicate information through "vibrations". They can convey location quality and distance based on the duration of these vibrations.
