* The **supply chain** refers to the  network of plants and vendors that supply raw material, components, and services to another.

* Because of the dependency on outside suppliers, one approach to SCM is to establish safety lead times based on purchasing time and balanced to account for inventory costs.
* The amount of safety lead time needed increases when we have more components externally supplied.
* *Reliable suppliers are extremely important to efficient operation of an assembly system that involves multiple purchased parts.*
* Having fewer vendors providing multiple parts might produce better on-time performance than having many vendors providing single parts
	* Purchases become a larger percentage, and therefore a higher-priority piece of the supplier's business.
	* Easier to keep track of suppliers if there are fewer of them. 
* Since delivery times for different parts may vary even with the same supplier, it makes sense to schedule them differently.
