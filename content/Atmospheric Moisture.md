* Takes the form of water vapor, liquid water, and ice, moisture is transferred via moving air. 
# Humidity
* **Humidity** - the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere, which can be expressed in many ways.
	* **Absolute Humidity** - the mass per volume of the water in the air.  *Since this changes when air expands or compresses, it is not useful in understanding the atmosphere*.
	* **Vapor Pressure** - denoted $e$ the amount of pressure contributed by the water vapor. 
	* **Water Vapor Capacity** - denoted $e_s$, it is the maximum amount of water vapor the air can hold. It varies by temperature, increasing exponentially. 
		* **Unsaturated air** - occurs when the weather is fair. It is when more water vapor can be introduced in the air. 
		* **Saturated air** - the air has as much water vapor as possible. This is indicated with the formation of precipitation and drops of water (i.e., clouds).
		* **Supersaturated** - the air has more water vapor than its water vapor capacity.
	* **Relative Humidity** - he ratio of how much water vapor is in the air relative to the water vapor capacity, indicating how close the air is to saturation. *It varies with temperature*. 
	* **Specific Humidity** - denoted $q$. It is expressed as the ratio of the mass of water vapor in some body of air to the total mass of that air. *Not dependent on temperature, pressure or volume*. 

* *Air at low temperatures can hold much less water vapor*. Thus, in cooling the air we change its ability to evaporate moisture. We achieve more relative humidity.

* *Specific humidity varies as a function of latitude. Higher specific humidity near the equator*. 
* A belt of high specific humidity straddles the equator, coinciding with the tropics. This is due to [[The Earth and Insolation|insolation]].
* *Ocean currents influence specific humidity* as they move warm and cold water which brings more / less humidity respectively.
* *Land influences humidity* due to topography that influences wind currents.
* *Dry Air is associated with low humidity*. Thus, deserts have low humidity. 
* Cold seasons have lower specific humidity.
