* A branch of [[Mathematics]] that deals with networks or graphs

* A **graph** $G$ is defined as an ordered pair $(V(G),E(G))$ where $V(G)$ is the **vertex set** and $E(G)$ is the **edge set**. Edges consist of pairs $(x,y)\mid x,y\in V(G)$. 
  
  When the context is clear, we abbreviate with $V$, $E$ and $xy=(x,y)$. We also assume $V,E$ are finite

* *Graphs abstract pairwise relations between objects*.
