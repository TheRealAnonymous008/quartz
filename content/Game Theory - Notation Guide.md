 * $x\succeq y$ -  preference relation. $x$ is at least as good as $y$. 
* $x\succ y$ - strict preference relation. $x$ is strictly better than $y$.
* $x\sim y$ - indifference relation. $x$ and $y$ are equally good. 
* $u(x)$ - the payoff function over outcomes 
* $v(a)$ - the payoff function over actions
* $A$ - set of actions 
* $X$ - set of outcomes
* $a$ - generic action
* $x(a)$ - the outcome of action $a$
* $\gamma$ - discounting factor
***** 
* $i$ - generic player
* $N$ - the set of players in the game 
* $_{-i}$ - subscript indicates that we should exclude player $i$
*****
* $\Gamma$ - a game
* $s_i$ - a pure strategy of player $i$
* $S_i$ - the set of strategies of player $i$
* $s$ -  a profile of pure strategies chosen by all $n$ players of the game. 
* $S$ - the set of all sets of strategies (consisting of all $S_i$). 
* $v_i$ - the payoff function for the $i$-th player .
* $v$ - the tuple of all payoff functions
* $v_i(s)$ - the payoff received by player $i$ under strategy profile $s$. 
* $s_i \succ_i s_i'$ - strictly dominance relation. $s_i$ strictly dominates $s_i'$.

* $s^D$ - strictly dominant strategy profile
* $s^W$ - weakly dominant strategy profile
* $s^\text{ES}$ - iterated-elimination equilibrium
* $s_i^\text{ES}$ - strategy of $i$-th player in iterated-elimination equilibrium.
