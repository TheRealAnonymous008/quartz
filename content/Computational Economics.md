* [ABM never took off in economics because it was already a “model-oriented” discipline.](https://economistwritingeveryday.com/2022/03/14/why-agent-based-modeling-never-happened-in-economics/) ABM is inherently empirical which means that: 
	* It is hard to validate the created model; 
	* It is hard to prove that these models are indeed theoretically sound; 
	* There are a lot of bad ABM models for economics compared to good ones since it is easy to do; and 
	* [[Data Analytics]] had more ground compared to [[Agent Based Modeling]]
