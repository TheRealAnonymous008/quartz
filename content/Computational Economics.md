* [ABM never took off in economics because it was already a “model-oriented” discipline.](https://economistwritingeveryday.com/2022/03/14/why-agent-based-modeling-never-happened-in-economics/) ABM is inherently empirical which means that: 
	* It is hard to validate the created model; 
	* It is hard to prove that these models are indeed theoretically sound; 
	* There are a lot of bad ABM models for economics compared to good ones since it is easy to do; and 
	* [[Data Analytics]] had more ground compared to [[Agent Based Modeling]]

* [^Steinbacher_2021]  gives a review on ABM with regards to modeling economic behavior 
	* In the context of computational social science, ABM can be characterized as having the following components 
		* Agents have *psychological traits* (heuristics) and socio-demographic *attributes*. These traits could be based on real world data. 
		* Agents operate on an *environment* where they interact with others. 
		* Agents operate under *rules of interactions* and decision making processes are deduced from social and psychological theories. 
		* *Macro-level structure* that [[Complex Systems|emergent]] as a consequence of micro-level behavior. Tuning the micro helps understand the macro. 
	* *Data driven ABMS are initialized and validated using data* from surveys, digital media, social [[Network Science|network data]], crowd sourced data, digital sensors and information networks, existing databases, census data, and urban data. 
	* *Heuristics can be used to model [[Human Biases|human behavior]]*. Agents in the system can either be "automatic" (i.e., have no cognitive function) or learn from the environment. 
		* Behavioral heuristics underutilize the possibilities offered by expectation formation theory -- that is, heuristics based on the expectation of a variable (such as price). 
		* Heuristics may provide a more accurate and robust tool for modeling action also within an uncertain environment than sophisticated techniques.
	* Besides modeling the behavior of agents we have to model *realistic networks of interactions* where these are relevant for the dynamics of the system
		* Large scale networks could be used to study cascades via **cascade models**.
		* ABM can be used to study *the extent to which network structure influences macroscopic outcomes. However, they do not answer whether the proposed structures are found in reality, how they formed, or how they might develop*
		* Modeling could be done using data or analyzing the dependencies of real world markets. 
	* *ABMs can be used to explain the stability of a financial system* 
		* Early work has focused on micro-structures such as transactions and trading 
		* They can help in identifying mechanisms that lead to instabilities, and to evaluate policies to mitigate them. 
		* They can also be used for risk analysis and to the extent that cascades in the system are affected by the network's structure. 
		* ABM could be used to test the effectiveness of micro and macroprudential policies to counteract banking crises.
		* *ABM can be used to generate a dataset to evaluate the consequences of policy*.
	* ABMs have so far mostly been used to generate insights and qualitative descriptions of scenario that may occur rather than quantitative forecasts.
	* *ABM can be extended to apply to heterogeneous agents* -- that is, agents that behave differently and not necessarily rationally .
	* *ABM can be used to explain experimental results*.
