* **Play** - pertains to the Experiential Systems of the game. It only occurs as players experience the [[Games as Rules|rules]] of the game in motion.
# What is Play?
* ***Play** is free movement within a more rigid structure*. As an expression of the system, we take advantage of the space of possibility given by the system's structure.
	* *Play both exists because of and opposes rigid structures*.
*  [[Rules of Play -- Game Design Fundamentals by Salen and Zimmerman|Salen and Zimmerman]] provide a broad typology of three possible descriptors (from narrowest to broadest)
	* **Game Play** - the formalized interaction that occurs when players follow the rules of a game and experience its system through play
		* [[The Fundamentals of Game Design|Games are a subset of play. Play is an element of games]].
	* **Ludic Activities** - play activities that include not only games, but also non-game behaviors we think of as playing. We may categorize them as follows [^1]
		* **Agon** - competitive play. Combat is artificially created and adversaries confront each other.
		* **Alea** - chance based play. All games that are based on a decision independent of the player.
		* **Mimicry** - role playing and make-believe play. One becomes an illusory character. The play of representation
		* **Ilinx** - playing with the physical sensation, with the goal of momentarily destroying the stability of perception.
		* **Paida** - wild, free-from improvisational play. 
		* **Ludus** - rule bound, regulated formalized play.
	* **Being Playful** - the idea of being in a playful state of mind. 
		* *Play is latent in every human activity*. You can take inspiration for play behavior and contexts anywhere. 
* **Transformative Play**  - a special case of play that occurs when the free movement of play alters the more rigid structure in which it takes shape.
	* *Whether or not play is transformative depends on how we look at the system -- that is, which elements actually change*. 
	* Every instance of play carries with it the seeds of transformative play. Thus *maximize play for your participants at every possible moment*.

# Games as Experiential Systems
### Play of Experience
* *To play a game is to experience the game*. Experience implies participation -- the player as a part of the game system.
* Experience come from the relationships between inputs, outputs, and internal player mechanisms. 
	* *Identifying the qualities of play you wish the players to experience is a useful way to frame game design problems*.
	* Game designers indirectly design player experience by designing the rules.
* Every game has a **core mechanic** which is the essential play activity players perform repeatedly in a game.
	* *The core mechanic contains the experiential building blocks of player interactivity*. 
	* If a game simply isn't fun to play, it is often the core mechanic that is the problem.
	* We may design the core mechanic by [[Creativity|breaking the rules]] or by taking inspiration from other core mechanics and varying them.
	* Remember, the core mechanic should facilitate meaningful play.
* *Game designers create activities for players* . Ask yourself what the player is actually doing when playing the game.

### Play of Pleasure
* *A game is a space in which a player's emotions and sense of desire undergoes manipulation and coercion*. 
	* This means translating the formal rules into an engaging experience of play.
	* Players accept rules not to restrict pleasure but to maximize them.
