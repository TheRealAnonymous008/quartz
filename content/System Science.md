* A **system** is an interconnected set of elements that is coherently organized in a structure, and which produces a characteristic set of behaviors. This is its **function** (for human-based systems) or **purpose** (for-non-human based systems)
	* A system is more than the sum of its parts. The *elements* of a system are usually the easiest parts to notice.
	* Many of the *interconnections* in systems operate through the flow of information (via decisions or actions) or resources. These serve to hold the system together and determines how it operates. 
	* The least obvious part of the system, its *function or purpose*, is often the most crucial determinant of the systemâ€™s behavior, and it can only be deduced by examining this behavior. 
	* The purpose of a system may be *emergent* and even accidental -- as in no actor intends for such to happen but the structure of the system makes it so. 
	* System *structure* is the source of system behavior. System behavior reveals itself as a series of events over time. The structure comes from interrelated stocks, flows, and feedback loops.
	* Systems can be *nested* -- containing smaller subsystems. 
	* Changing a system's elements, interconnections or purposes *changes* its behavior.
